# What are Web4 First Principles?

[Web4x](../../Glossary.md/Web4x.md) represents the next generation of web architecture, positioning itself as "the Internet of Services as a basis for the Internet of Things" derived from TLA (The Last Architecture). It's not just a framework but a complete paradigm shift from document-centric to object-centric web development.

## Core Capabilities

- **[Radical Object-Oriented Programming](../../Glossary.md/Radical-OOP.md)**: Everything is an object, no standalone functions allowed
- **[ONCE](../../Glossary.md/ONCE.md) Core Framework**: The defining factor that determines whether something is Web4x or not
- **[UCP](../../Glossary.md/UCP.md) Component Model**: Fractal architecture with strict quality gates (Unit, Component, Package)
- **Cross-Domain Interoperability**: Components work across different vendor browsers and domains
- **Enterprise CMMI Level 4**: Proven in Deutsche Bahn Data Center management with mission-critical reliability

## Key Benefits

- **"Write ONCE, Deploy Anywhere"**: Vendor/language independent deployment
- **Component Exchange**: Components can be exchanged between different company domains via drag & drop
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage with no CommonJS allowed
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Peer-to-peer communication with particle/wave event model
- **myData under myControl**: User ownership and control of personal data

## Essential Constraints

- **No Standalone Functions**: Everything must be in classes with static methods only
- **Strict Separation of Concerns**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript never mixed
- **CMMI Level 4 Compliance**: No ambiguities, disjunct semantic resolution required
- **[Interface](../../Glossary.md/Interface.md) Implementation**: All components must implement explicit interfaces
- **[Namespace](../../Glossary.md/Namespace.md) Management**: Hierarchical organization of classes and objects required
