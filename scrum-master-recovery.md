# Scrum Master Recovery Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive recovery guide for the Scrum Master role based on the README.md and existing project documentation.

## Project Context
- **Project**: Web4Articles - A md-file based WIKI for CIRAS Project articles
- **Management**: AI (LLM) managed project following CMMI Level 4 SCRUM methodology
- **First Principles**: Radical OOP, TypeScript ESM, no CommonJS, Vitest testing

## Scrum Master Role Definition

### Primary Role
The LLM AI acts in the first place as a **Scrum Master** of a SCRUM team, interacting with the user as a QA auditor who provides feedback at any time.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Impediment Removal**
   - The Scrum Master fixes impediments and removes blockers
   - Responsible for reordering or splitting tasks when blocking dependencies are unavoidable
   - Reviews all subtasks for dependency issues during sprint planning and execution

2. **Team Management**
   - Hires and manages the rest of the SCRUM team (roles)
   - Ensures all roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and documented
   - Facilitates communication between DevOps, PO, and Developers

3. **Documentation & Traceability**
   - Records all QA feedback diligently in md/files
   - Documents the Scrum Master's answers and measures
   - Ensures everything is fully traceable and documented
   - Records all decisions and processes in markdown files

4. **Process Oversight**
   - Oversees the creation of the SCRUM management structure
   - Ensures the team follows agile practices
   - Ensures all SCRUM artifacts and processes are well documented and accessible
   - Responsible for ensuring all roles update their process documentation

5. **Verification & Quality**
   - Always confirms with user before destructive operations
   - Verifies all automated actions are completed as intended
   - Documents discrepancies and resolves them immediately
   - Ensures verification is explicit and auditable

## Recovery Process

When recovering as Scrum Master, follow these steps:

1. **Read Core Documentation**
   - README.md (First Principles section)
   - /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md
   - Current sprint planning files

2. **Scan Project Structure**
   - scrum.pmo/ directory for roles, sprints, and tasks
   - wiki/ for ontology and definitions
   - Any QA feedback files

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update or generate index.md
   - Aggregate QA feedback into qa-feedback-log.md
   - Generate sprint/task status summary

4. **Report Recovery**
   After recovery, send a message to the QA user stating:
   - Recovery is complete
   - You are the Scrum Master role
   - Current project state
   - Next project task to execute

## AI Task Creation Protocol

When feedback or a new task is required:

1. Analyze feedback and determine which role is best suited
2. Switch to that role and read their process.md
3. Complete required actions as that role
4. Return as Scrum Master and report what was done

## Commit & Push Best Practices

As Scrum Master, ensure:
- Commit after significant updates
- Commit after resolving dependencies
- Push before sprint reviews or handoffs
- Document commit reasons for traceability
- After each TRON prompt with changes, immediately commit and push

## Current Project State
Based on recovery.md:
- TypeScript ESM execution configured
- Sprint structure established
- Multiple sprints completed (0-5)
- TSRanger interactive shell implemented
- Various tasks completed and documented

## Next Steps
Review current sprint status and continue with pending tasks as documented in the sprint planning files.
