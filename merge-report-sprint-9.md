## Key Findings

1. **Sprint Numbering**: Sprint 7 does not exist in any branch, confirming our need for the sprint registry system.

2. **Content Preservation**: All QA feedback and documentation successfully preserved through merges.

3. **Script Enhancement Needed**: The v2 merge script exists in one of the unmerged branches and should be prioritized.

4. **Conflict Patterns**: Most conflicts occur in:
   - recovery.md (chronological entries)
   - index.md (file listings)
   - Project journal entries

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Push current release/dev state to preserve progress
   - Prioritize merging branch containing v2 merge scripts
   - Complete remaining 8-10 branch merges

2. **Process Improvements**:
   - Implement automated sprint discovery before creating new sprints
   - Add pre-merge validation for sprint numbers
   - Enhance content-aware merge for index.md files

3. **Next Sprint Planning**:
   - Use Sprint 10 for next work (Sprint 7 skipped)
   - Update all agents about sprint registry usage

## Conclusion

Task 9.22 has made significant progress with 6 branches successfully integrated and all expected sprints (except non-existent Sprint 7) now present in release/dev. The remaining conflicts are manageable and the foundation for complete daily integration is established.
