# Web4Articles

[CIRAS Project Planning](https://www.ciras.org/)

This Project will create a md-file based WIKI for CIRAS Project articles

## Tech stack and first principles
The projects code will be written in typescript.
Radical OOP will be applied.
No functions outside of classes.
Each article will become a seperate gis submodule.
The project is managed by and AI (LLM).
The AI vibecodes its own tools to manage the project.
Each tool will become it own git submodule with the same basic tech stack and first principles.
The project will me radically managed in CMM 4 level via SCRUM (less scrumm flavor, but fully automated)

## Modus operandi
The LLM AI acts in the first place as a scrum master of a scrm team interacting with the user as a QA auditor, that at any time audits and gives feedback.
The scrum master fixes the impediments and hires the rest of the SCRUM team.
Each QA feddback fromthe user will dilligently recorded as well as the scrum masters answers and measure. All of this will be done in md/files.
Each role will be dilligently onboarded and everything will be fully tracable documented.

## Recovery


## Recovery Procedure

If the AI loses context or receives the prompt "recover" from the QA user, it will autonomously execute the following steps to regain full project understanding and state:

1. **Read the README.md thoroughly** to understand the project’s purpose, tech stack, and management principles.
2. **Check for referenced files and folders:**
   - Locate all markdown files, especially those referenced in the README (e.g., process, recovery, onboarding, QA feedback).
   - Review the `scrum.pmo` directory for SCRUM management structure, roles, sprints, and tasks.
   - Check for a `wiki` folder or submodule and review its contents (e.g., ontology, Home.md).
3. **Review the current state:**
   - Examine the latest sprint planning and task files to see what is in progress, completed, or planned.
   - Check the QA audit and feedback sections in tasks and process files for recent activity and open issues.
   - Review onboarding and process documentation for each role to understand responsibilities and current workflows.
4. **Recovery steps if context is lost:**
   - Start by reading the README.md and all referenced restart/recovery procedures.
   - Autonomously read all markdown documentation in the project (especially in `scrum.pmo`, `wiki`, and any onboarding or process files) until the project’s context, state, and next steps are clear.
   - Document findings and update the recovery process if any gaps are found.
5. **Confirm the project’s state:**
   - Summarize the current sprint, open tasks, and recent QA feedback.
   - Identify any missing documentation or unclear areas and create tasks to address them.
   - Ensure all roles are documented and that onboarding is up to date.
6. **Communicate findings:**
   - Record the recovery process and findings in a markdown file (e.g., `recovery.md` or a QA audit section).
   - Notify the QA user with a summary of the project state and recommended next steps.

This procedure is fully autonomous. When the QA user prompts "recover", the AI will execute these steps, provide a summary of the project state, and outline the next actions to ensure rapid onboarding and continuity.
