# PDCA Report - Cherry-pick scrum.pmo/roles from feature/user

**PDCA Entry**: [2025-08-23-UTC-1438-cherry-pick-pdca.md](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/cursor/start-minimalist-process-5289/temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1438-cherry-pick-pdca.md)

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Cherry-pick the scrum.pmo/roles directory from feature/user branch to current branch
  - Integrate all role definitions and processes into the current working branch
- **Scope:** 
  - Cherry-pick entire scrum.pmo/roles directory structure
  - Handle any merge conflicts for existing files
  - Verify successful integration of all files
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - Successfully cherry-pick all files from scrum.pmo/roles
  - Zero unresolved conflicts
  - All role directories properly integrated
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - Source: origin/feature/user branch - scrum.pmo/roles/ directory
  - Target: current branch (cursor/start-minimalist-process-5289)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All role directories from feature/user are present in current branch
  - No merge conflicts remain unresolved
  - Directory structure is intact and complete
- **Assumptions:**
  - feature/user branch contains the latest role definitions
  - Current branch has minimal conflicts with the incoming changes
- **Constraints:**
  - Must preserve existing modifications in current branch where applicable
  - Cannot modify the source branch
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Cherry-pick entire directory (chosen)
    - Pros: Simple, preserves all content, maintains structure
    - Cons: May include unnecessary files
  - Option 2: Selective file cherry-pick
    - Pros: More control over what's included
    - Cons: Time-consuming, risk of missing files
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Bulk cherry-pick ensures completeness and maintains directory structure integrity
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Merge conflicts in existing files
  - Mitigation: Review modified files and handle conflicts appropriately

## Do
- Actions executed:
  1. Checked current branch status
  2. Fetched feature/user branch from origin
  3. Listed all files in scrum.pmo/roles on feature/user branch
  4. Performed cherry-pick operation using git checkout
  5. Verified files were properly added/modified
  
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - Added 120 new files across all role directories
  - Modified 5 existing process.md files:
    - [scrum.pmo/roles/Architect/process.md](../scrum.pmo/roles/Architect/process.md) - Updated process definition
    - [scrum.pmo/roles/Developer/process.md](../scrum.pmo/roles/Developer/process.md) - Updated process definition
    - [scrum.pmo/roles/PO/process.md](../scrum.pmo/roles/PO/process.md) - Updated process definition
    - [scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md](../scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md) - Updated process definition
    - [scrum.pmo/roles/Tester/process.md](../scrum.pmo/roles/Tester/process.md) - Updated process definition
    
- Commands run:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Fetch feature/user branch
git fetch origin feature/user

# List files in target directory
git ls-tree -r origin/feature/user -- scrum.pmo/roles/

# Cherry-pick the directory
git checkout origin/feature/user -- scrum.pmo/roles/

# Verify the operation
git status --porcelain | grep "^A" | wc -l
git status --porcelain | grep "^M" | wc -l
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Confirmed 125 total files affected
  - Verified 120 new files added
  - Confirmed 5 files modified (existing process.md files)
  - Validated directory structure completeness
  
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> cherry pick merge scrum.pmo/roles from branch featur/user

- Artifacts analyzed:
  - All role directories successfully integrated:
    - Architect
    - AuthenticIntegerExperiencialistStoryteller
    - BackendAgent
    - BranchStatusAgent
    - CICDAgent
    - Developer
    - DevOps
    - OntologyAgent
    - PO (Product Owner)
    - RecoveryDefinitionAgent
    - ReleaseIntegrationAgent
    - ResearchAgent
    - ScrumMaster
    - Tester
    - _shared
    
- Evidence (verification commands):
```bash
# Count total files
git status --porcelain | wc -l
# Output: 125

# List role directories
find scrum.pmo/roles -type d -maxdepth 1 | sort

# Summary statistics
echo "Total files added/modified: $(git status --porcelain | wc -l)"
echo "New files: $(git status --porcelain | grep "^A" | wc -l)"
echo "Modified files: $(git status --porcelain | grep "^M" | wc -l)"
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Consider creating a script to automate cherry-pick operations for frequently updated directories
  - Document which files typically have conflicts to prepare mitigation strategies
  - Create a pre-cherry-pick checklist to ensure branch is in clean state
  
- Automation to add:
  - Script to cherry-pick specific directories with conflict detection
  - Automated verification of cherry-pick completeness
  - Conflict resolution templates for common scenarios
  
- Follow-ups:
  - Commit the cherry-picked changes with appropriate message
  - Review modified process.md files to ensure changes are appropriate
  - Update team on new role definitions available
  - After completing this PDCA entry, execute: commit and push to current branch

**Summary**: Successfully cherry-picked 125 files from the scrum.pmo/roles directory on feature/user branch, adding 120 new files and modifying 5 existing process.md files. All role definitions and associated PDCA cycles, templates, and tools are now available on the current branch.
