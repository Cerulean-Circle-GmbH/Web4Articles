### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: Create dedicated recovery directory (Decision 1c from previous PDCA)
- [x] Completed decision: Implement all requested workflow enhancements
- [x] **Decision 1: Auto-merge Frequency** → **Selected: a**
  - a) Merge to release/dev after every single PDCA commit ✅
  - b) Batch merge PDCAs at end of session
  - c) Manual trigger with automatic option available

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-23-UTC-1518)**
```quote
1c
update the root readme to go on from there wit recovery 

create a git automation, that merges every git add, commit and push after every pdca into release/dev.

whenever you do not find a file that i request, try quickly to find it in release/dev and cherry pick merge it.

add all of this to the pdca process understanding. 

then create a branch save/start from this branch
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect! I'll implement decision 1c to create a dedicated recovery directory, update the README with recovery instructions, create git automation for auto-merging to release/dev, add automatic file search in release/dev when files aren't found, update the PDCA process documentation, and finally create a save/start branch.

**Learning Applied:** Automating repetitive tasks and creating clear recovery paths significantly improves workflow efficiency.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Implementation:**
1. Create dedicated `/recovery` directory and move recovery procedure
2. Update root README with recovery quick start section
3. Create git automation script for PDCA auto-merge to release/dev
4. Update PDCA process to include automatic file search in release/dev
5. Create save/start branch to preserve this optimal state

**Expected Benefits:**
- Streamlined recovery process
- Automated git workflow
- Reduced friction when files are missing
- Preserved optimal configuration state

---

## **🔧 DO** 

**Actions Executed:**

1. **Created Recovery Infrastructure:**
```bash
mkdir -p /workspace/recovery
mv /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/BackendAgent/recovery-start-command.md /workspace/recovery/start-command.md
```

2. **Updated Root README.md:**
- Added "Quick Start Recovery" section after project description
- Included PDCA setup check instructions
- Added cherry-pick commands for missing files
- Referenced recovery directory

3. **Created Git Automation Script (recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh):**
- Automatic merge to release/dev after PDCA commits
- Stash handling for uncommitted changes
- Temporary branch creation for clean merges
- Two modes: standalone merge or full PDCA workflow

4. **Enhanced howto.PDCA.md Git Protocol:**
- Added auto-merge to release/dev requirement
- Added file search protocol for missing files
- Included cherry-pick commands for release/dev

5. **Updated Previous PDCA Decision:**
- Marked Decision 1c as selected (dedicated recovery directory)

**Files Modified/Created:**
- Created: `/recovery/` directory
- Moved: `recovery-start-command.md` → `/recovery/start-command.md`
- Created: `/recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh` (executable)
- Modified: `/README.md` - Added recovery section
- Modified: `/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md` - Enhanced git protocol
- Modified: Previous PDCA to record decision 1c

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Infrastructure Creation (SUCCESS)**
```bash
$ ls -la /workspace/recovery/
drwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 recovery
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 2107 pdca-auto-merge.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 5234 start-command.md
```

**README Update (VERIFIED)**
- ✅ Quick Start Recovery section added
- ✅ PDCA setup check instructions included
