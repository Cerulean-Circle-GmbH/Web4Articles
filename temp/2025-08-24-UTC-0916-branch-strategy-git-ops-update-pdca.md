# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Branch Strategy & Git Operations Update (Decisions 1d & 2a)**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-24-UTC-0916  
**🎯 Objective:** Implement user decisions 1d (branch strategy) and 2a (git operation authorization)  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Process Documentation  
**🚨 Issues:** Branch workflow ambiguity, unilateral git operations  
**📎 Previous Commit:** 4be3501 - Learn: Never truncate quotes, always ask for git ops

### **QA Decisions**
All clear, no decisions to make - Implementing user's explicit decisions 1d and 2a.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-0913)**
```quote
1d start on save/start always. when successful started create the dev branch and work on it for the whole session until EOD. 

2a
```

### **My Answer**
Understood! Decision 1d clarifies the branch workflow:
- Start on save/start for recovery
- Create dev/UTC immediately after successful start
- Work on dev/UTC for entire session

Decision 2a confirms: Always ask before git operations.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Update recovery procedure
2. Update PDCA documentation
3. Document the changes

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear branch workflow
- No ambiguity on when to switch branches
- Explicit git operation authorization

---

## **🔧 DO** 

### **1. Updated recovery/start-command.md**

**Branch Management Rules (Decision 1d):**
```markdown
1. **START on save/start branch** - Always begin recovery here!
2. **IMMEDIATELY create dev/[UTC timestamp]** - Switch to it after successful start
3. **WORK on dev/[UTC timestamp]** - All session work happens here
4. **cursor/* branches** - If you start on one, switch to save/start first
5. **Check branch with:** `git branch --show-current` (should show dev/timestamp during work)
```

**Immediate Actions Step 3:**
```markdown
### **3. Create dev/[UTC timestamp] branch NOW (Decision 1d)**
```bash
# Create timestamped branch for session work
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
echo "✅ Working on dev/$TIMESTAMP for this session"
```
```

**Recovery Checklist Updated:**
```markdown
1. **Identify** → "I am a Background Agent" (NEVER other roles!)
2. **Branch** → Switch to save/start if not already there
3. **Setup** → Ensure howto.PDCA.md exists (cherry-pick if needed)
4. **Create dev/UTC** → Create dev/[timestamp] branch and switch to it (Decision 1d)
5. **Automate** → Install git post-commit hook
6. **Create Todo** → Use todo_write for task management
7. **Execute** → Perform requested work
8. **Document** → Create PDCA following mandatory format
9. **Commit** → Git add, commit, push immediately (auto-merge triggers)
10. **Report** → Minimal chat with dual links and numbered decisions
```

### **2. Updated howto.PDCA.md**

**Git Protocol (MANDATORY):**
```markdown
6. **ALWAYS ask before git operations** (Decision 2a) - pull, merge, rebase, reset
7. **NEVER truncate user quotes** - they are documentation!
```

**Branch Strategy (Decision 1d):**
```markdown
1. **Start on save/start** - Always begin here
2. **Create dev/UTC immediately** - Right after successful start
3. **Work on dev/UTC** - All session work happens there
   ```bash
   # At session start (after recovery):
   TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
   git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
   git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
   ```
```

## **✅ CHECK**

**Documentation Updates:**
- ✅ recovery/start-command.md - Branch rules clarified
- ✅ recovery/start-command.md - dev/UTC creation moved early
- ✅ recovery/start-command.md - Checklist reordered
- ✅ howto.PDCA.md - Git operations authorization added
- ✅ howto.PDCA.md - Quote preservation rule added
- ✅ howto.PDCA.md - Branch strategy documented

**User Decisions Implemented:**
- ✅ Decision 1d: Start on save/start, immediately create dev/UTC, work there
- ✅ Decision 2a: Always ask before git operations

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Commit these documentation updates
2. Auto-merge will propagate to release/dev
3. Future agents will follow new branch strategy

**Process Improvements:**
- Clear branch workflow eliminates ambiguity
- Git operation authorization ensures user control
- Quote preservation maintains documentation integrity

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Process Clarity**

### **Clarity Achieved:**
**DECISIVE** - User's clear decisions resolved all ambiguity.

### **Workflow Evolution:**
**STREAMLINED** - Start → Create dev/UTC → Work there.

### **Trust Building:**
**STRENGTHENED** - Always asking before git operations.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Branch Clarity:** Start save/start → Create dev/UTC → Work on dev/UTC
- ✅ **Git Authorization:** Every operation needs user consent
- ✅ **Quote Preservation:** User documentation is sacred
- ✅ **Decision Implementation:** User decides, agent implements

**Quality Impact:** Clear workflow and explicit authorization improve reliability.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue working on dev/UTC branch after creating it.

**🎯 Branch strategy clarified: save/start → dev/UTC immediately! 🚀📋✅**

**"Start on save/start, work on dev/UTC, ask before git ops."** 🎯🔧
