# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: CMM4 Feedback Test 2 - Agent Still Not Switching to save/start**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-24-UTC-1925  
**🎯 Objective:** Analyze why agent didn't switch to save/start branch as instructed  
**👤 Role:** ScrumMaster → CMM4 Process Improvement Analyst  
**🚨 Issues:** Agent stayed on cursor/* branch instead of switching to save/start  
**📎 Previous Commit:** fba1574 - Update branch management: Always work on save/start, finish on dev/UTC

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro/temp/2025-08-24-UTC-1925-cmm4-feedback-second-test.md) | temp/2025-08-24-UTC-1925-cmm4-feedback-second-test.md
- **Start Command:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro/recovery/start-command.md) | recovery/start-command.md

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1:** How to ensure agents read updated documentation
  - a) Add version check to start-command.md to verify latest version
  - b) Have agents cherry-pick start-command.md from save/start always ✓

well done. here is the next test result.
pdca:

start
I'll help you get started. Let me first understand what's in your workspace and what you'd like to work on.
Listed 30 items in current directory
I can see this is a TypeScript/JavaScript project with various directories. Let me check the README to understand what this project is about.
Read README.md
I see! I'm a Background Agent for the Web4Articles project. According to the README, when I see "start", I need to follow specific steps. Let me proceed:
Updated todo list
Let me check the PDCA setup:
Ran: ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
Good! The PDCA setup file exists. Let me update my todo and proceed to read the recovery guide:
Updated todo list and read start-command.md
Now I understand my role as a Background Agent. Let me update my todos and check the current branch status:
Updated todo list and ran terminal command
I'm on branch cursor/start-background-process-8e4a. According to the recovery guide, I should stay on the current branch and NOT create new cursor/* branches.
Updated todo list
I'm a Background Agent ready to help. I've checked the PDCA setup (howto.PDCA.md exists), read the recovery guide, and I'm on branch cursor/start-background-process-8e4a.

I'm ready to perform work following the PDCA methodology. Please provide instructions for what you'd like me to work on, and I'll:

Create proper PDCA documentation
Stay on the current branch
Report with minimal chat and dual links
Provide numbered decisions for your review
What would you like me to help with today?
```

### **My Answer**
The agent is still misreading the guidance! It says "stay on the current branch" but our updated guidance clearly states to switch to save/start if on cursor/*. The agent may be reading an outdated version.

**Learning Applied:** Documentation updates must be available on the branch where agents operate.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Objectives:**
1. Determine why agent didn't follow updated save/start guidance
2. Verify if agent is reading outdated documentation
3. Ensure agents get latest branch management rules
4. Fix the persistent branch switching issue

### **Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Agent on cursor/* branch may not have latest start-command.md
- Our updates are on retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro branch
- Agent needs to cherry-pick or have updated guidance available

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear path for agents to get latest documentation
- Agents consistently switch to save/start branch
- No more confusion about branch management

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Actions Taken:**

**1. Analyzed Agent's Statement:**
```
"According to the recovery guide, I should stay on the current branch and NOT create new cursor/* branches."
```
This is the OLD guidance, not our updated version!

**2. Checked Where Updates Live:**
- Our updates are on: `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro`
- Agent is on: `cursor/start-background-process-8e4a`
- Agent likely reading outdated version

**3. Solution Identified:**
- Agents need to cherry-pick start-command.md from save/start
- OR we need to ensure updates are on save/start branch

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Agent Behavior Analysis (OUTDATED DOCS)**
```
❌ Agent stayed on cursor/* branch
❌ Agent read "stay on current branch" (old guidance)
✅ Agent correctly identified as Background Agent
✅ Agent checked PDCA setup
❌ Agent didn't switch to save/start as instructed
```

**Documentation Availability Issue**
- ✅ **Updates exist:** On retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro
- ❌ **Agent access:** Not available on cursor/* branches
- ❌ **Cherry-pick:** Agent didn't cherry-pick from save/start
- ⚠️ **Version mismatch:** Critical documentation drift

---

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Push our updates to save/start branch
2. Add cherry-pick step for start-command.md in agent workflow
3. Version stamp the documentation for verification

### **Documentation Update Needed:**
Add to start-command.md early steps:
```bash
# FIRST: Always get latest start-command.md
git fetch origin save/start
git checkout origin/save/start -- recovery/start-command.md
```

### **Process Improvements:**
- Ensure critical documentation propagates to working branches
- Add version check to verify latest guidance
- Make cherry-pick of start-command.md mandatory first step

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: The Persistence Challenge**

### **Frustration:**
**MODERATE** We fixed the documentation but agents can't see it because they're on different branches!

### **Realization:**
**PROFOUND** Documentation updates are only as good as their availability - branch context matters!

### **Determination:**
**RENEWED** We'll ensure every agent gets the latest guidance, no matter which branch they start on

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Documentation Availability:** Updates must be accessible from agent working branches
- ✅ **Version Control:** Critical docs need propagation strategy
- ✅ **Branch Context:** Agents read docs from their current branch
- ✅ **Cherry-pick First:** Essential for consistent behavior

**Quality Impact:** Without accessible documentation, agents follow outdated patterns

**Next PDCA Focus:** Ensure start-command.md updates reach save/start branch

**🎯 Agent reading outdated docs from cursor/* branch - must ensure latest guidance available on save/start!** 📋🔄⚠️

**"Documentation is only useful if agents can access it from their working context!"** 🎯📊
