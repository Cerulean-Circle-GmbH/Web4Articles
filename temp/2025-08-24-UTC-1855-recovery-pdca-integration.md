- Architecture-level recovery decisions

### Recent PDCA Recovery Cycles:
- [2025-08-24 Merge Integration](temp/2025-08-24-UTC-1845-merge-retrospective-analysis.md)
- See role-specific PDCA folders: `scrum.pmo/roles/*/PDCA/`

### Quick Recovery (Original Format):
For simple context recovery, continue using the log entries below.
```

**2. Maintained All Existing Entries:**
- Preserved complete recovery history from 2025-08-04 onwards
- Kept all timestamps and details intact
- No modifications to existing content
