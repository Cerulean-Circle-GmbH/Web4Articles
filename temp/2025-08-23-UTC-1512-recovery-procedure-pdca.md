### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: Document recovery procedure for "start" command
- [ ] **Decision 1: Recovery Procedure Location**
  - a) Keep in BackendAgent role directory for agent-specific recovery
  - b) Move to _shared directory for all agents to access
  - c) Create dedicated recovery directory for all recovery procedures

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-23-UTC-1510)**
```quote
it was quite a hustle to get to this point. review our chat and creat a recover procedure for yourself to get to this exact point where you understand pdcas and their reporting to me in a minimalist way when i start the agent with the word "start".
```

### **My Answer**
I'll review our entire journey and create a comprehensive recovery procedure that captures all the key learnings - from the initial confusion about missing files, through cherry-picking from different branches, to achieving the optimal minimalist PDCA reporting format you prefer.

**Learning Applied:** The journey from confusion to clarity provides valuable recovery patterns that can help future agents quickly reach optimal state.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Approach:**
1. Review entire chat history to identify key learning moments
2. Extract critical steps that led to PDCA mastery
3. Create streamlined recovery procedure
4. Document quick-start checklist for "start" command
5. Include user preferences discovered through interaction

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Fast recovery to optimal PDCA state
- Minimal setup time for new sessions
- Clear checklist for "start" command
- Preserved learning from this session

## **🔧 DO** 

**Actions Executed:**

1. **Analyzed Chat Journey:**
   - Started with "start minimalist" → basic project creation
   - First cherry-pick from feature/user → got roles but not PDCA docs
   - Request for howto.pdca.md → file not found
   - Second cherry-pick from release/dev → acquired proper documentation
   - "report ot correct" feedback → learned minimal chat reporting
   - "number the decisions" → enhanced format implementation

2. **Created Recovery Procedure Structure:**
   - Immediate actions (0-2 minutes)
   - PDCA reporting protocol (minimal format)
   - PDCA file requirements (8 sections)
   - Recovery checklist (7 steps)
   - Key learnings from journey
   - Quick reference guide

3. **Documented Critical Elements:**
   ```markdown
   - Check for howto.PDCA.md existence
   - Cherry-pick from release/dev if missing
   - Minimal chat response template
   - Numbered decisions format
   - Dual links requirement
   - Immediate commit/push protocol
   ```

**Files Created:**
- `scrum.pmo/roles/BackendAgent/recovery-start-command.md` - Comprehensive recovery guide
