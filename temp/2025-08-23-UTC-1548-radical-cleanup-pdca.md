as this is the save/start branch you can radically remove every part of the readme that would confuse a starting background agent. 🕵️‍♂️
```

### **My Answer**
Absolutely! I'll be a detective and remove EVERYTHING that could confuse a starting background agent. This save/start branch should have a crystal clear, minimal README that gets agents up and running instantly without confusion.

**Learning Applied:** Save/start branch is for clean starts - remove all legacy complexity!
