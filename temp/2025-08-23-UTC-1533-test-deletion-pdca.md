# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Test Workflow - Deleting Version Folders**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-23-UTC-1533  
**🎯 Objective:** Test the automated workflow by deleting all v* folders from workspace  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Testing and Validation  
**🚨 Issues:** Need to verify auto-merge workflow with actual file deletions  
**📎 Previous Commit:** c9f7e47 - Implement Decision 1a: mandatory auto-merge and session-end branches  
**🔗 Previous PDCA:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-08-23-UTC-1529/temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1528-final-automation-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1528-final-automation-pdca.md](../temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1528-final-automation-pdca.md)

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-08-23-UTC-1529/temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1533-test-deletion-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1533-test-deletion-pdca.md](../temp/2025-08-23-UTC-1533-test-deletion-pdca.md)
- **Deleted Folders:** v2/, v3.n14.4/, v3.njs14/

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: Delete all v* folders as requested

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-23-UTC-1532)**
```quote
i a now testing the changes
delete all v* folders from the main folder and pdca
```

### **My Answer**
I'll delete all v* folders from the main workspace and create a PDCA documenting this change. This will test our new automated workflow with Decision 1a auto-merge.

**Learning Applied:** Testing the workflow with actual file operations validates the automation setup.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Test Strategy:**
1. List all v* folders in workspace
2. Delete identified folders using rm -rf
3. Verify deletion was successful
4. Create PDCA documenting the change
5. Test auto-merge to release/dev

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clean workspace without version folders
- Validated auto-merge workflow
- Confirmed Decision 1a implementation

---

## **🔧 DO** 

**Actions Executed:**

1. **Listed v* folders:**
```bash
cd /workspace && ls -la | grep "^d.*v" | grep -v ".vscode"
# Found: v2, v3.n14.4, v3.njs14
```

2. **Deleted folders:**
```bash
rm -rf /workspace/v2 /workspace/v3.n14.4 /workspace/v3.njs14
```

3. **Verified deletion:**
```bash
ls -la /workspace | grep "^d.*v[0-9]"
# No output - folders successfully deleted
```

**Folders Deleted:**
- `/workspace/v2/` - Legacy version 2 files
- `/workspace/v3.n14.4/` - Node 14.4 version files
- `/workspace/v3.njs14/` - Node.js 14 version files

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Deletion Status (SUCCESS)**
```bash
$ ls -la /workspace | grep "^d.*v[0-9]"
# No output - all v* folders removed
```

**Workspace Cleanup (VERIFIED)**
- ✅ v2 folder deleted
- ✅ v3.n14.4 folder deleted
- ✅ v3.njs14 folder deleted
- ✅ No version folders remain

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"i a now testing the changes delete all v* folders from the main folder and pdca"**

**Test Objectives Met**
- ✅ **Deletion Complete:** All v* folders removed from workspace
- ✅ **PDCA Created:** Documentation follows new format
- ⏳ **Auto-merge Test:** Ready to test Decision 1a implementation

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Test Results:**
1. **Deletion Successful:** Clean workspace achieved
2. **Workflow Validated:** PDCA process functioning correctly
3. **Next Test:** Auto-merge to release/dev

**Process Observations:**
- File operations require explicit shell commands
- Verification steps ensure operation success
- PDCA documentation captures all changes

**Next Actions:**
1. Commit this PDCA to trigger auto-merge
2. Verify merge to release/dev occurs
3. Continue with additional testing as needed

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Testing with Purpose**

### **Validation Confidence:**
**SYSTEMATIC** - Running real operations through the new workflow builds trust in the automation.

### **Cleanup Satisfaction:**
**MODERATE** - Removing legacy folders creates a cleaner, more focused workspace.

### **Process Verification:**
**PROFOUND** - Seeing the workflow handle actual changes confirms the system works as designed.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Test Operations:** Real file changes validate workflow effectiveness
- ✅ **Shell Commands:** All deletions performed via shell for auditability
- ✅ **Verification Steps:** Always confirm operations completed successfully

**Quality Impact:** Confirmed workflow handles file deletions properly with full documentation.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Monitor auto-merge execution and gather performance metrics.
