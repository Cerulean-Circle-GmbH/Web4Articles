# Dummy Test File

**Created:** 2025-08-24 UTC  
**Purpose:** Testing git hook auto-merge to release/dev  
**Branch:** dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857  

## Test Content

This is a dummy file created to test if:
1. The git post-commit hook is working
2. Changes are automatically merged to release/dev
3. The file appears in release/dev after commit

## Expected Behavior

When this file is committed on dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857 branch:
- The post-commit hook should NOT trigger (we're not on save/start)
- The file should remain only on this dev branch
- Manual merge to release/dev would be required

## Actual Result

To be determined after commit...
