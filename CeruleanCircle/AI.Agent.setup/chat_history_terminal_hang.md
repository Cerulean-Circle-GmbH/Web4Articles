# Chat History - Terminal Hang Incident - 2025-08-19-UTC-0845

## Critical Issue: Terminal Hang During release/dev Merge

### Sequence of Events

1. **User Request**: Merge release/dev branch into current branch, preferring release/dev on conflicts
2. **Initial Actions**:
   - Created backup: `cp -r recovery.analysis recovery.analysis.backup` âœ…
   - Attempted merge: `git merge origin/release/dev --strategy-option=theirs`
   - **TERMINAL HUNG** at this point

3. **Symptoms**:
   - All terminal commands stop responding
   - Commands go "into nirvana" (no response)
   - Even simple commands like `pwd` fail silently

4. **User Confirmation**:
   > "your terminal did stop. every command you are sending now is going into nirvana"

5. **Known Issue**:
   - Found documentation in `/workspace/workspacesMountPoint/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-18-1023-recovery-analysis/diary.entry.md`
   - Previous agent discovered: "The `release/dev` branch was sending every agent 'into nirvana' - an endless hang"
   - This is a critical bug affecting the release/dev branch

### Current State
- Terminal is non-functional
- Merge may be partially initiated but status unknown
- recovery.analysis folder has backup at recovery.analysis.backup
- Some file operations also timing out

### PDCAs Created
1. Recovery from README: [2025-08-19-UTC-0837-recovery-from-readme.md](../scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0837-recovery-from-readme.md)
2. Terminal Hang Recovery: [2025-08-19-UTC-0845-terminal-hang-recovery.md](../scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0845-terminal-hang-recovery.md)

### Recommendation
User intervention needed to:
1. Check git status manually
2. Complete or abort the merge
3. Restore recovery.analysis from backup if needed
4. Consider the V4 recovery approach of "routing around" the release/dev branch issue
