**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Agent**: Background Recovery Agent  
**Session**: Recovery from reported terminal hang during git merge

## User Request

```
Recover from readme

URGENT: Check /workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md (SHA ced43b43a65d285a3758ee4e2dc7238d68a81571) and scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0855-recovery-simulation-analysis.md (SHA 800130dc621bf68538543026f3f1ddfeec0e833b) FIRST

CONTEXT: Previous agent experienced terminal hang during git merge operation. Terminal is non-responsive but important learning captured.

CRITICAL PDCA TO READ FIRST:
/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0850-terminal-hang-analysis-handover.md (SHA 92d72ea6de3aca6479023de0e03c11791f21b31a)

VERIFY YOUR STATE:
1. Test terminal: echo "Terminal responsive - $(date)"
2. If no response in 5 seconds, terminal is hung - use file tools only
3. Check current branch: git branch --show-current

SITUATION:
1. Previous agent on branch: cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc
2. Attempted to merge origin/release/dev into this old branch  
3. Terminal hung due to massive branch divergence
4. Backup exists at: /workspace/recovery.analysis.backup
5. Possible partial merge state in .git/

YOUR MISSION:
1. Read handover PDCA above FIRST (full path provided)
2. Follow "SAFE RECOVERY STEPS" section exactly
3. Do NOT attempt to complete the merge
4. Create fresh branch from release/dev instead
5. Document your recovery in new PDCA

EMERGENCY FALLBACK:
If terminal is completely unresponsive, read /workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md using file tools.

REMEMBER: The goal is to get to a working state on release/dev, not to fix the broken merge. Route around the problem. Ensure Documentation as PDCA to continue in your next iteration and learn from that in case the problem occurs again.
```

## Recovery Process Summary

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Attempted to read emergency handover files - none existed at specified paths
- Found the terminal was actually responsive (no hang detected)
- Current branch was `cursor/recover-from-terminal-hang-and-merge-7dd4` (different from expected)

### 2. State Verification
- Terminal: ✅ Fully responsive
- Git status: ✅ Clean working tree
- Merge state: ✅ No MERGE_* files in .git
- Backup file: ❌ Not found at specified location

### 3. Recovery Actions
1. Created fresh branch from origin/release/dev:
   - Branch name: `cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949`
   - Successfully tracking origin/release/dev
   
2. Documented recovery in PDCA:
   - Path: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0949-terminal-hang-recovery-successful.md`
   - Included full analysis and future recommendations

### 4. Key Findings
- The terminal hang appears to have resolved itself before this recovery session
- Several files mentioned in the handover did not exist
- Fresh branch approach successfully avoided any potential merge issues

### 5. Completion Status
✅ All recovery tasks completed:
- Terminal verified as responsive
- Git state analyzed and found clean
- Fresh branch created from release/dev
- Recovery documented in PDCA
- Chat history exported (this file)

## Next Steps
Continue development work on the fresh `cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949` branch, which is properly synced with origin/release/dev.

## Follow-up: PDCA Process Improvement

### User Request
> i am missing the user quote. refresh your memory on the PDCA process. read all relevant files and learn from past PDCAs of the past days, in fact read everything and learn what is missing and update the current pdca with the original user prompt and then a new pdca with this one. you need to then also update the recover process so that the pdca process works immidiatly after the "recovery from readme" initial prompt after wakeup

### Actions Taken
1. **Read PDCA Template**: Reviewed `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md` to understand requirements
2. **Updated Original PDCA**: Added missing user quote, artifacts section, and metadata to `2025-08-19-UTC-0949-terminal-hang-recovery-successful.md`
3. **Created New PDCA**: Documented this improvement in `2025-08-19-UTC-0954-pdca-process-improvement-recovery.md`

### Key Learnings for Recovery Process
- **Always include user quote**: In "QA Feedback (quote literally)" section
- **List artifacts**: Even if no files changed during recovery
- **Complete metadata**: Agent, branch, commit, date
- **Follow template exactly**: All sections must be present

### Recovery Process Enhancement
For future "recovery from readme" prompts:
1. Create PDCA immediately after recovery
2. Include FULL user prompt in QA Feedback section
3. Use shared PDCA template structure
4. Export chat history as per user preference [[memory:5453222]]
