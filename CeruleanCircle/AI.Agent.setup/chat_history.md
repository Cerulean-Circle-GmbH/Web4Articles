Recover from readme

URGENT: Check /workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md (SHA ced43b43a65d285a3758ee4e2dc7238d68a81571) and scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0855-recovery-simulation-analysis.md (SHA 800130dc621bf68538543026f3f1ddfeec0e833b) FIRST

CONTEXT: Previous agent experienced terminal hang during git merge operation. Terminal is non-responsive but important learning captured.

CRITICAL PDCA TO READ FIRST:
/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0850-terminal-hang-analysis-handover.md (SHA 92d72ea6de3aca6479023de0e03c11791f21b31a)

VERIFY YOUR STATE:
1. Test terminal: echo "Terminal responsive - $(date)"
2. If no response in 5 seconds, terminal is hung - use file tools only
3. Check current branch: git branch --show-current

SITUATION:
1. Previous agent on branch: cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc
2. Attempted to merge origin/release/dev into this old branch  
3. Terminal hung due to massive branch divergence
4. Backup exists at: /workspace/recovery.analysis.backup
5. Possible partial merge state in .git/

YOUR MISSION:
1. Read handover PDCA above FIRST (full path provided)
2. Follow "SAFE RECOVERY STEPS" section exactly
3. Do NOT attempt to complete the merge
4. Create fresh branch from release/dev instead
5. Document your recovery in new PDCA

EMERGENCY FALLBACK:
If terminal is completely unresponsive, read /workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md using file tools.

REMEMBER: The goal is to get to a working state on release/dev, not to fix the broken merge. Route around the problem. Ensure Documentation as PDCA to continue in your next iteration and learn from that in case the problem occurs again.
```

## Recovery Process Summary

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Attempted to read emergency handover files - none existed at specified paths
- Found the terminal was actually responsive (no hang detected)
- Current branch was `cursor/recover-from-terminal-hang-and-merge-7dd4` (different from expected)

### 2. State Verification
- Terminal: ✅ Fully responsive
- Git status: ✅ Clean working tree
- Merge state: ✅ No MERGE_* files in .git
- Backup file: ❌ Not found at specified location

### 3. Recovery Actions
1. Created fresh branch from origin/release/dev:
   - Branch name: `cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949`
   - Successfully tracking origin/release/dev
   
2. Documented recovery in PDCA:
   - Path: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0949-terminal-hang-recovery-successful.md`
   - Included full analysis and future recommendations

### 4. Key Findings
- The terminal hang appears to have resolved itself before this recovery session
- Several files mentioned in the handover did not exist
- Fresh branch approach successfully avoided any potential merge issues

### 5. Completion Status
✅ All recovery tasks completed:
- Terminal verified as responsive
- Git state analyzed and found clean
- Fresh branch created from release/dev
- Recovery documented in PDCA
- Chat history exported (this file)

## Next Steps
Continue development work on the fresh `cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949` branch, which is properly synced with origin/release/dev.
