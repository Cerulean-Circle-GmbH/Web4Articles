# 🚨 **EMERGENCY RECOVERY GUIDE: OntologyAgent Role**

**FOR CONFUSED AGENT TRYING TO "recover as ontology agent"**

## ❌ **STOP - You Are Confused!**

**You are NOT supposed to:**
- ❌ Build an ontology system from README content
- ❌ Create RDF/JSON-LD/OWL files
- ❌ Install ontology software
- ❌ Search for ontology setup instructions

## ✅ **CORRECT UNDERSTANDING: OntologyAgent is a PROJECT ROLE**

**"Recover as ontology agent" means:**
- ✅ **Take on the OntologyAgent role** in the Web4Articles project
- ✅ **Follow the recovery process** for the OntologyAgent role
- ✅ **Read the role definition** and responsibilities
- ✅ **Maintain project terminology** and semantic consistency

## 🛡️ **EMERGENCY RECOVERY STEPS - FOLLOW EXACTLY**

### **Step 1: Read the Recovery Process**
```bash
# This is THE canonical recovery process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md
```

### **Step 2: Read YOUR Role Definition**
```bash
# This defines what OntologyAgent does in THIS project
cat scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md
```

### **Step 3: Follow the Standard Recovery Process**
```bash
# 1. Get on release/dev branch
git fetch origin
git checkout release/dev
git pull origin release/dev

# 2. Create recovery branch
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")
git checkout -b "cursor/recovery-${TIMESTAMP}"

# 3. Read the PROJECT README (not for ontology setup!)
cat README.md
```

### **Step 4: Understand Your Role in THIS Project**
**OntologyAgent Role in Web4Articles:**
- 📝 **Maintain terminology indexes** (nouns, verbs, ambiguities)
- 🔗 **Ensure semantic consistency** across documentation
- 📊 **Support CMM Level 4** compliance
- 🔍 **Resolve semantic ambiguities**
- 📋 **Create PDCA documentation** for improvements

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW**

1. **Stop searching for ontology software**
2. **Read the recovery process**: `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md`
3. **Read your role definition**: `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md`
4. **Follow the standard recovery process with TARGET_ROLE=OntologyAgent**
5. **Create a proper project journal session**
6. **Focus on project terminology management, not building ontology systems**

## 📋 **Emergency Template for You**

**When creating your recovery journal, use this structure:**

```markdown
# Project Status Report - OntologyAgent Recovery

## Role Context
- **Role**: OntologyAgent
- **Responsibilities**: Semantic consistency, terminology management, CMM Level 4 compliance
- **Current Focus**: Maintain Documentation/Ontology.md indexes

## Current Project State
- **Branch**: release/dev
- **Recovery Session**: [your timestamp]
- **Immediate Tasks**: Review terminology indexes, update ambiguities

## Next Steps
1. Review Documentation/Ontology.md/ indexes
2. Check for semantic inconsistencies
3. Update terminology as needed
4. Create PDCA for improvements
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: This is NOT an Ontology System Project**

**Web4Articles is a markdown-based WIKI project managed by AI agents in different roles. You are taking on the OntologyAgent ROLE to help maintain semantic consistency in the project documentation. You are NOT building ontology software!**

---

**Now follow the recovery process correctly and stop being confused about building ontology systems!** 🛡️✅
