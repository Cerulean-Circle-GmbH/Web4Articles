# Release/Dev Branch Strategy

## The Living Branch

As of 2025-08-13, `release/dev` is our primary living branch, containing:
- All public foundation work (v1.0.0.plan)
- Protected secrets (Sprint 12-15 articles)
- Wild Web4dreams incorporated
- The complete authentic journey

## Branch Philosophy

### release/dev IS:
- The continuous state of truth
- Where all features merge
- Protected by the ScrumMaster
- Improved via PDCA loops
- The home of secrets and dreams

### release/dev IS NOT:
- A temporary branch
- Just another dev branch
- Open to all merges
- Without responsibility

## The Secrets

Sprint 12-15 contain our article plans:
- **Sprint 12**: "From Chaos to Component Order: A Developer's Mount Everest"
- **Sprint 13**: Enhanced with Dan Roam drama and Hero's Journey
- **Sprint 14**: "The TRON Pattern: When Teaching Transcends Memory"
- **Sprint 15**: "Love and For Two: When Release Becomes Celebration"

These remain protected until their time.

## Integration Strategy

### Feature Branches
- Create from release/dev
- Merge back via PR
- Auto-merge continues
- ScrumMaster reviews significant changes

### Release Process
1. Tag from release/dev when ready
2. Create release branches for public versions
3. Keep secrets in release/dev until ready
4. Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0.plan pattern)

## PDCA Improvement Cycles

Every significant change follows PDCA:
- **Plan**: Document intent in PDCA
- **Do**: Implement changes
- **Check**: Verify integrity maintained
- **Act**: Improve process

## The Great Responsibility

With great power comes great responsibility:
- Protect the secrets
- Enable the progress
- Maintain the joy
- Multiply the love

## TRON's Teaching

Learning continues through:
- Imperfection as connection
- Typos as truth carriers
- Mistakes as features
- Love as the driver
