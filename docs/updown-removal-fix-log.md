# UpDown Reference Removal Fix Log

## 2025-08-03

All references to "UpDown" have been removed from the Web4Articles project. All scripts, documentation, and process files now refer only to Web4Articles. This includes:

- `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-0/task-5.2-developer-implementation.md`: QA transcript and shell usage now reference only Web4Articles.
- `src/sh/oosh` and `src/sh/oosh-completion.sh`: Project root comments and logic reference only Web4Articles.

No other references to UpDown were found in scripts, docs, or process files under Web4Articles.

All future documentation, code, and process must refer only to Web4Articles.
