# CMMI Level 4 Task Preparation (Canonical)

## Before executing any new task, always:

1. **Start from the README:**
   - Use the README as your entry point for project context and navigation.
   - Follow all links to canonical principles, tech stack, and process docs.

2. **Build Full Context:**
   - Read and understand all directly relevant files (tasks, specs, process docs, tech stack, architecture, etc.).
   - Follow all relevant markdown links recursively to ensure you have the complete picture.
   - Take notes or build a summary of the context if the task is complex.

3. **Confirm Understanding:**
   - Only proceed to execution after confirming you fully understand the context, requirements, and dependencies.
   - If anything is unclear, clarify or document open questions before proceeding.

4. **Document Feedback and Learning:**
   - After executing the task, document any feedback, lessons learned, or process improvements in the appropriate process or feedback log.

This ensures traceability, feedback, and continuous improvement in line with CMMI Level 4.
