- Index.md needs updating with new files from Sprint 2 tasks and retro journal entries.
- QA feedback already aggregated in `qa-feedback-log.md`; latest entry from 2025-08-10 about retro scheduling and agent interview process.
- No role-specific recovery checklists found in process.md files.

- Test suite shows 4 failures in prompt-line behavior tests (g[tab][down] sync issues).
- Project in beta status per retro overview; tests red in prompt-line behavior subset.

**Current Project State:**
- Role: Scrum Master (autonomous recovery agent)
- Sprint 2 Task 7 (prompt-line editing with cursor) implementation complete, under QA review

## 2025-08-10 (merged from chore/branch-review-checklist)
- Generated branch checklist.
- Pushed branch. Next: open PR titled 'cleanup branches'.

## 2025-08-19T08:45:00Z

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README.md procedure.
- DevOps Environment Verification Results:
  - Docker: NOT INSTALLED (command not found)
  - Node.js: v22.16.0 (installed, satisfies requirements)
  - npm: v10.9.2 (installed)
  - PlantUML: NOT INSTALLED
  - Graphviz (dot): NOT INSTALLED
  - VS Code Dev Containers: Cannot verify in this environment
- Note: Docker, PlantUML, and Graphviz are missing. [[memory:5469213]] The user prefers using updown-dev-container for development.
- Read handover.backend.agent.md which directs to backend agent recovery procedures.

**Current Project State:**
- Latest sprint appears to be Sprint 8 (empty directory)
- Sprint 5 exists with QA feedback
- Multiple sprints (0-6, 8) have been created
- QA feedback log contains entries up to 2025-08-10 including retro scheduling and interview setup

**Next Steps:**
- Continue recovery by analyzing all sprint planning files and current task states
- Determine which sprint is currently active and what tasks are pending
- Update index.md with any new files created since last index (2025-08-06)

**Analysis Complete:**
- Found extensive recovery analysis work in `recovery.analysis/` directory with multiple versions (v1-v4)
- Latest agent recovery process documented in `agent.recovery.v4.md` with 3-6 minute recovery time
- Most recent project journal entry: 2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster with PDCA reporting clarification
- Sprint structure shows sprints 0-6 and 8 created, but Sprint 8 directory is empty
- Recovery analysis includes role-specific recovery files for all SCRUM roles
- PDCA reporting pattern clarified: minimal chat responses with dual links, comprehensive content in PDCA files
- Multiple design documents created for recovery process improvements

**Role:** Scrum Master
- Responsible for facilitating SCRUM process, removing impediments, and ensuring documentation
- Must follow PDCA reporting pattern: comprehensive content in files, dual links in chat
- Need to address missing DevOps tools (Docker, PlantUML, Graphviz) as impediments

**Next Concrete Task:**
- Update index.md with all new markdown files created since 2025-08-06
- Export chat history as per user preference [[memory:5453222]]
- Create proper Sprint 8 planning and structure if needed

## 2025-08-20T07:11:00Z

**Summary:**
- Performed V4 fast track recovery in 5 minutes
- Identified role: ScrumMaster
- Sprint 8 in planning stage with 5 tasks focused on TSRanger TUI behavior
- Created recovery PDCA but initially failed to push (accumulated 540 commits)
- Learned critical lesson: MUST commit and push after EVERY PDCA loop

**Critical Learning:**
- Every PDCA must be immediately committed and pushed
- Created process correction documentation
- Fixed 540 unpushed commits issue
- Now following correct PDCA process
