# Recovery Log

## 2025-08-11

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Read the ResearchArchitect retrospective and prepared ResearchAgent integration.
- Added a CLI-accessible `ResearchAgent` with `incorporateAfterRecovery` to acknowledge and wire in post-recovery research incorporation.

**Artifacts:**
- `src/ts/layer2/ResearchAgent.ts`
- Retro source: `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-10-1030/retro/answer.ResearchArchitect.md`

**Next Steps:**
- Extend `ResearchAgent.incorporateAfterRecovery` to update indices and backlinks automatically.
- Link research artifacts into `index.md` and QA logs, ensuring DRY references.

## 2025-08-04

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery as per README.md procedure.
- Read project purpose, tech stack, and management principles.
- Indexed all markdown files and their roles in `index.md`.
- Aggregated QA feedback in `qa-feedback-log.md` (none found in this repo).
- Referenced all role process files for recovery checklists.
- Summarized sprints and tasks (see `scrum.pmo/sprints/initialization.md`, `sprint-0/planning.md`, and `sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Checked for broken links, missing backlinks, and outdated templates (none found in indexed files).
- No recovery issues or gaps detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Sprint 1, Task: Add tssh shell wrapper and backend (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Ensure all acceptance criteria for tssh are met and documented.

## 2025-08-06

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Regenerated markdown index with roles and dates (`index.md`).
- Aggregated QA feedback into `qa-feedback-log.md` from sprint/task QA sections.
- Reviewed role process checklists for alignment; no blocking gaps detected.
- Performed a basic pass for local link targets in markdown; no obvious breakages detected in referenced artifacts.

**Current Project State:**
- TypeScript ESM execution via ts-node is failing in tests (ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and tssh CLI behavior not yet implemented to spec.
- Documentation and sprint/task structure are present and linked.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Sprint 1 Task 1: tssh shell wrapper and `TSsh.ts` backend, including `installCompletion()`.
- Fix ts-node ESM invocation for completion backend in shell and tests (use `--esm` and TS_NODE_PROJECT consistently).
- Ensure tests in `/test` pass and update docs if interfaces change.

**Role:** Scrum Master (autonomous). Will coordinate Developer/Tester tasks to address the above.

## 2025-08-08

**Summary:**
- Planned Sprint 2 to deliver a ranger-like interactive shell leveraging `TSCompletion` and `DefaultCLI`.
- Added planning and tasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/`.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Sprint 2 starting with Architect spec, then TUI core, completion integration, and execution bridge.

## 2025-08-08 (later)

**Summary:**
- Followed README.md recovery guidance to proceed autonomously.
- Added Sprint 2 task to refactor `TSRanger` into one class per TS file.
- Completed the refactor by extracting `RangerModel`, `RangerView`, and `RangerController` into separate files and wiring via `TSRanger`.

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests and ensure no regressions. Address any issues if they arise.

## 2025-08-08 (merge verification and Sprint 3 QA review)
## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 / fallback `[hostname] user@pwd`).
- Fixed selected-row alignment across all columns by padding before applying ANSI styles.
- Added resize-aware rendering to keep footer anchored at the bottom with required blank lines.
- Verified via scripted `tsranger` test sequences.

**Next Steps:**
- Write E2E tests per `task-1.5` and PO user guide per `task-1.6`.


**Summary:**
- Performed recovery per README procedure and validated merge health.
- Ran clean install (npm ci) and full test suite: 7 files passed, 35 tests passed, 1 skipped; no failures.
- Observed Node engine warnings for `execa` and `vite` with current Node v20.4.0; functionality unaffected.
- Reviewed `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-3/planning.md`: all tasks present and currently unchecked; no Sprint 3 delivery yet to QA.

**Current Project State:**
- Core CLI and completion features remain green per tests; no post-merge regressions detected.
- Sprint 3 work (GitScrumProject templating, submodule integration, release/recovery automation, tests, docs) is pending.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Sprint 3 Task 1.0 (Architect spec) then proceed to scaffold and submodule integration tasks.
- Consider upgrading Node to >= v20.19.0 (or 22.12+) to satisfy `execa`/`vite` engine ranges and silence warnings.

## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Executed README.md recovery focused on Sprint 2 work.
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized command preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 or hostname/user/pwd) in `src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts`.
- Updated Sprint 2 task statuses (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-2.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-3.md`).

**Current Project State:**
- TSRanger now renders with one empty line above preview and one between preview and footer; footer uses blue background with white text and fills width.
- Preview line is prefixed by prompt derived from `$PS1` or synthesized `[hostname] user@pwd`.

**Next Steps:**
- Add/adjust tests for scripted preview spacing and prompt logic; run full test suite and collect QA feedback.

## 2025-08-09 (later)

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery from README and verified Sprint 2 Task 7 (prompt-line editing with cursor and shell-like completion).
- Implemented controller prompt editing, tab completion, and view cursor rendering; synchronized filters via model.
- Added/updated tests: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.cursor.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.prompt.test.ts`.
- Ran full test suite: all tests passing.

**Current Project State:**
- Task 7 implementation complete and under QA review.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to QA review for Task 7, then mark Done upon approval.

## 2025-08-11 09:55 UTC - Recovery from Main Branch README

**Trigger:** User requested "recover from readme on branch main" and branch overview creation

**Actions Taken:**
1. Switched to main branch and synced with origin (51 commits fast-forwarded)
2. Read and analyzed README.md for project principles and structure
3. Created structured journal entry at `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-11-0955/project.state.md`
4. Fetched all remote branches and categorized them
5. Created comprehensive `branch-overview.md` with three categories:
   - Unmerged branches (11)
   - Already merged branches (7)
   - Branches not to touch (3)

**Key Findings:**
- Project follows strict TypeScript/ESM, radical OOP, and CMMI Level 4 SCRUM
- Multiple TSRanger-related branches indicate active development
- Sprint 4 devcontainer work appears in multiple branches
- 7 branches can be cleaned up as they're already merged

**Next Steps:**
- Review Sprint 4 devcontainer branches for alignment
- Consider cleanup of merged branches
- Continue with any pending user requests

**Recovery Status:** Complete

   - Key issues documented: PlantUML diagram fixes, completion script failures, TSRanger refactoring, project retro scheduling
   - Recent feedback includes project retro instructions and agent interview setup

5. **Role Process Review:**
   - Reviewed ScrumMaster process.md - no specific recovery checklists found
   - Process files contain role definitions, responsibilities, and commit/push best practices
   - AI Task Creation Protocol documented for feedback processing

6. **Sprint & Task Status Summary:**
   - **Sprint 0:** 8 main tasks, all unchecked [ ] - appears not started
   - **Sprint 1:** 2 tasks listed, both unchecked [ ] - appears not started
   - **Sprint 2:** 7 main tasks with many subtasks
     - Tasks 1-5 marked complete [x]
     - Task 6 (Tab behavior) pending [ ]
     - Task 7 (Refactor typing model) pending [ ]
     - Many subtasks completed, some QA reviews pending
   - **Sprint 3:** 8 tasks, all unchecked [ ] - not started
   - **Sprint 4:** 6 tasks, all unchecked [ ] - not started

7. **Consistency Checks:**
   - All sprint task files have proper backlinks on line 1
   - No broken links detected in sampled files
   - Markdown structure follows project conventions

**Key Findings:**
- Project follows strict TypeScript/ESM, radical OOP principles, and CMMI Level 4 SCRUM
- Significant work completed on Sprint 2 (TSRanger implementation)
- Sprint 0 and 1 show as not started (checkboxes unchecked) despite later sprints being worked on
- No recovery-specific checklists in role process files
- Wiki submodule appears empty

**Current Project State:**
- Core CLI and TSRanger features implemented with tests passing
- Sprint 2 mostly complete with some pending tasks
- Sprint 3 and 4 planned but not started
- Project structure well-organized with comprehensive documentation

**Next Steps:**
- Based on sprint status, the next concrete task appears to be Sprint 2 Task 6 (Tab behavior) or Task 7 (Refactor typing model)
- Alternatively, could begin Sprint 3 Task 1.0 (GitScrumProject templating)
- Consider reviewing why Sprint 0/1 show as incomplete despite later work

**Recovery Status:** Complete

**Role:** I am operating as the Scrum Master, responsible for facilitating the SCRUM process, removing impediments, and ensuring proper documentation and process adherence.
