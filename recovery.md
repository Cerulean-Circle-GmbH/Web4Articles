# Recovery Log

## 2025-08-04

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery as per README.md procedure.
- Read project purpose, tech stack, and management principles.
- Indexed all markdown files and their roles in `index.md`.
- Aggregated QA feedback in `qa-feedback-log.md` (none found in this repo).
- Referenced all role process files for recovery checklists.
- Summarized sprints and tasks (see `scrum.pmo/sprints/initialization.md`, `sprint-0/planning.md`, and `sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Checked for broken links, missing backlinks, and outdated templates (none found in indexed files).
- No recovery issues or gaps detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Sprint 1, Task: Add tssh shell wrapper and backend (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Ensure all acceptance criteria for tssh are met and documented.

## 2025-08-06

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Regenerated markdown index with roles and dates (`index.md`).
- Aggregated QA feedback into `qa-feedback-log.md` from sprint/task QA sections.
- Reviewed role process checklists for alignment; no blocking gaps detected.
- Performed a basic pass for local link targets in markdown; no obvious breakages detected in referenced artifacts.

**Current Project State:**
- TypeScript ESM execution via ts-node is failing in tests (ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and tssh CLI behavior not yet implemented to spec.
- Documentation and sprint/task structure are present and linked.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Sprint 1 Task 1: tssh shell wrapper and `TSsh.ts` backend, including `installCompletion()`.
- Fix ts-node ESM invocation for completion backend in shell and tests (use `--esm` and TS_NODE_PROJECT consistently).
- Ensure tests in `/test` pass and update docs if interfaces change.

**Role:** Scrum Master (autonomous). Will coordinate Developer/Tester tasks to address the above.

## 2025-08-08

**Summary:**
- Planned Sprint 2 to deliver a ranger-like interactive shell leveraging `TSCompletion` and `DefaultCLI`.
- Added planning and tasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/`.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Sprint 2 starting with Architect spec, then TUI core, completion integration, and execution bridge.

## 2025-08-08 (later)

**Summary:**
- Followed README.md recovery guidance to proceed autonomously.
- Added Sprint 2 task to refactor `TSRanger` into one class per TS file.
- Completed the refactor by extracting `RangerModel`, `RangerView`, and `RangerController` into separate files and wiring via `TSRanger`.

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests and ensure no regressions. Address any issues if they arise.
