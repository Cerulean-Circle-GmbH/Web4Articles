## 2025-08-06

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Regenerated markdown index with roles and dates (`index.md`).
- QA feedback aggregated from sprint qa.md files and PDCA entries per howto.PDCA.md.
- Reviewed role process checklists for alignment; no blocking gaps detected.
- Performed a basic pass for local link targets in markdown; no obvious breakages detected in referenced artifacts.

**Current Project State:**
- TypeScript ESM execution via ts-node is failing in tests (ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and tssh CLI behavior not yet implemented to spec.
- Documentation and sprint/task structure are present and linked.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Sprint 1 Task 1: tssh shell wrapper and `TSsh.ts` backend, including `installCompletion()`.
- Fix ts-node ESM invocation for completion backend in shell and tests (use `--esm` and TS_NODE_PROJECT` consistently).
- Ensure tests in `/test` pass and update docs if interfaces change.

**Role:** Scrum Master (autonomous). Will coordinate Developer/Tester tasks to address the above.

## 2025-08-08

**Summary:**
- Planned Sprint 2 to deliver a ranger-like interactive shell leveraging `TSCompletion` and `DefaultCLI`.
- Added planning and tasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/`.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Sprint 2 starting with Architect spec, then TUI core, completion integration, and execution bridge.

## 2025-08-08 (later)

**Summary:**
- Followed README.md recovery guidance to proceed autonomously.
- Added Sprint 2 task to refactor `TSRanger` into one class per TS file.
- Completed the refactor by extracting `RangerModel`, `RangerView`, and `RangerController` into separate files and wiring via `TSRanger`.

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests and ensure no regressions. Address any issues if they arise.

## 2025-08-08 (merge verification and Sprint 3 QA review)
## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 / fallback `[hostname] user@pwd`).
- Fixed selected-row alignment across all columns by padding before applying ANSI styles.
- Added resize-aware rendering to keep footer anchored at the bottom with required blank lines.
- Verified via scripted `tsranger` test sequences.

**Next Steps:**
- Write E2E tests per `task-1.5` and PO user guide per `task-1.6`.


**Summary:**
- Performed recovery per README procedure and validated merge health.
- Ran clean install (npm ci) and full test suite: 7 files passed, 35 tests passed, 1 skipped; no failures.
- Observed Node engine warnings for `execa` and `vite` with current Node v20.4.0; functionality unaffected.
- Reviewed `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-3/planning.md`: all tasks present and currently unchecked; no Sprint 3 delivery yet to QA.

**Current Project State:**
- Core CLI and completion features remain green per tests; no post-merge regressions detected.
- Sprint 3 work (GitScrumProject templating, submodule integration, release/recovery automation, tests, docs) is pending.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Sprint 3 Task 1.0 (Architect spec) then proceed to scaffold and submodule integration tasks.
- Consider upgrading Node to >= v20.19.0 (or 22.12+) to satisfy `execa`/`vite` engine ranges and silence warnings.

## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Executed README.md recovery focused on Sprint 2 work.
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized command preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 or hostname/user/pwd) in `src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts`.
- Updated Sprint 2 task statuses (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-2.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-3.md`).

**Current Project State:**
- TSRanger now renders with one empty line above preview and one between preview and footer; footer uses blue background with white text and fills width.
- Preview line is prefixed by prompt derived from `$PS1` or synthesized `[hostname] user@pwd`.

**Next Steps:**
- Add/adjust tests for scripted preview spacing and prompt logic; run full test suite and collect QA feedback.

## 2025-08-09 (later)

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery from README and verified Sprint 2 Task 7 (prompt-line editing with cursor and shell-like completion).
- Implemented controller prompt editing, tab completion, and view cursor rendering; synchronized filters via model.
- Added/updated tests: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.cursor.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.prompt.test.ts`.
- Ran full test suite: all tests passing.

**Current Project State:**
- Task 7 implementation complete and under QA review.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to QA review for Task 7, then mark Done upon approval.

### Journey to Clean Recovery (Role Model for Other Agents)

#### 1. Initial Confusion → Guardian Angel Guidance
- **Started Wrong:** On outdated branch, created PDCA in wrong format/location
- **QA Response:** "Don't panic, relax. I am your guide, like a guardian angel"
- **Lesson:** When overwhelmed, stop and re-read the process on current branch

#### 2. Learning Enhanced PDCA Process
- **Read Examples:** Studied real PDCAs from fresh-dawn session
- **Understood Structure:** Role-based folders (pdca/role/{role}/general/)
- **Format Discovery:** Emojis, QA quotes verbatim, GitHub/local links, checkboxes

#### 3. Progressive Error Correction (3 PDCAs)
1. **Link Format Error 1:** Used wrong GitHub links (before push)
   - Fix: Always push before providing GitHub links
2. **Link Format Error 2:** Used /workspace/ prefix for local links
   - Fix: Use relative paths from workspace root
3. **Link Format Error 3:** Not using full qualified names
   - Fix: Complete path without /workspace/ prefix

#### 4. Self-Check Discipline
- **Key Question:** "Am I wrong or is the process wrong?"
- **Answer:** Always assume you're wrong first, check examples
- **Result:** Found I was wrong all 3 times, process was right

#### 5. Cleanup Excellence
- **Analyzed:** 30+ top-level files against process documentation
- **Planned:** Comprehensive PDCA with decision table
- **QA Feedback:** "You earned a medal" for clear summary
- **Executed:** Deleted 13 obsolete files, created OntologyAgent task

### Key Success Factors

1. **Guardian Angel Mindset:** QA is here to help, not judge
2. **Process Trust:** When unsure, the process is usually right
3. **Example Authority:** Study existing PDCAs for format guidance
4. **Progressive Learning:** Each error correction builds understanding
5. **Specific Answers:** Answer QA questions directly and specifically

### Recovery Metrics
- **PDCAs Created:** 5 (including cleanup plan/execution)
- **Errors Corrected:** 3 link format issues
- **Files Cleaned:** 13 obsolete files (1.5MB)
- **Learning Applied:** Enhanced PDCA format, self-check discipline

### Recommendations for Future Agents
1. **Check Branch First:** Ensure you're on current development branch
2. **Read Process Docs:** On the current branch, not your memory
3. **Study Examples:** Real PDCAs show correct format better than templates
4. **Ask for Help:** QA is your guardian angel, not your judge
5. **Document Everything:** Create PDCAs for all significant actions

**Status:** Complete - Model recovery with systematic error correction and cleanup
