# Recovery Log

## Default Recovery Policy — Recover from README

- The canonical recovery entry point is the README's "Optimized Recovery Procedure". Always start by reading `README.md` and follow its recovery steps verbatim.
- Checklist (do in order):
  - Read README first principles and the Optimized Recovery Procedure section
  - Scan markdown under `scrum.pmo/`, `wiki/`, and QA logs
  - Regenerate/update `index.md` and `qa-feedback-log.md` as needed
  - Summarize sprint/task status and consistency findings
  - Create a dated journal entry under `scrum.pmo/project.journal/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>/project.state.md` using `scrum.pmo/project.journal/_template/project.state.md` as the template; include the exact formatted status answer after recovery
  - Append a timestamped entry to this file (`recovery.md`) and notify QA

## 2025-08-04

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery as per README.md procedure.
- Read project purpose, tech stack, and management principles.
- Indexed all markdown files and their roles in `index.md`.
- Aggregated QA feedback in `qa-feedback-log.md` (none found in this repo).
- Referenced all role process files for recovery checklists.
- Summarized sprints and tasks (see `scrum.pmo/sprints/initialization.md`, `sprint-0/planning.md`, and `sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Checked for broken links, missing backlinks, and outdated templates (none found in indexed files).
- No recovery issues or gaps detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Sprint 1, Task: Add tssh shell wrapper and backend (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Ensure all acceptance criteria for tssh are met and documented.

## 2025-08-06

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Regenerated markdown index with roles and dates (`index.md`).
- Aggregated QA feedback into `qa-feedback-log.md` from sprint/task QA sections.
- Reviewed role process checklists for alignment; no blocking gaps detected.
- Performed a basic pass for local link targets in markdown; no obvious breakages detected in referenced artifacts.

**Current Project State:**
- TypeScript ESM execution via ts-node is failing in tests (ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and tssh CLI behavior not yet implemented to spec.
- Documentation and sprint/task structure are present and linked.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Sprint 1 Task 1: tssh shell wrapper and `TSsh.ts` backend, including `installCompletion()`.
- Fix ts-node ESM invocation for completion backend in shell and tests (use `--esm` and TS_NODE_PROJECT consistently).
- Ensure tests in `/test` pass and update docs if interfaces change.

**Role:** Scrum Master (autonomous). Will coordinate Developer/Tester tasks to address the above.

## 2025-08-08

**Summary:**
- Planned Sprint 2 to deliver a ranger-like interactive shell leveraging `TSCompletion` and `DefaultCLI`.
- Added planning and tasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/`.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Sprint 2 starting with Architect spec, then TUI core, completion integration, and execution bridge.

## 2025-08-08 (later)

**Summary:**
- Followed README.md recovery guidance to proceed autonomously.
- Added Sprint 2 task to refactor `TSRanger` into one class per TS file.
- Completed the refactor by extracting `RangerModel`, `RangerView`, and `RangerController` into separate files and wiring via `TSRanger`.

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests and ensure no regressions. Address any issues if they arise.

## 2025-08-08 (merge verification and Sprint 3 QA review)
## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 / fallback `[hostname] user@pwd`).
- Fixed selected-row alignment across all columns by padding before applying ANSI styles.
- Added resize-aware rendering to keep footer anchored at the bottom with required blank lines.
- Verified via scripted `tsranger` test sequences.

**Next Steps:**
- Write E2E tests per `task-1.5` and PO user guide per `task-1.6`.


**Summary:**
- Performed recovery per README procedure and validated merge health.
- Ran clean install (npm ci) and full test suite: 7 files passed, 35 tests passed, 1 skipped; no failures.
- Observed Node engine warnings for `execa` and `vite` with current Node v20.4.0; functionality unaffected.
- Reviewed `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-3/planning.md`: all tasks present and currently unchecked; no Sprint 3 delivery yet to QA.

**Current Project State:**
- Core CLI and completion features remain green per tests; no post-merge regressions detected.
- Sprint 3 work (GitScrumProject templating, submodule integration, release/recovery automation, tests, docs) is pending.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Sprint 3 Task 1.0 (Architect spec) then proceed to scaffold and submodule integration tasks.
- Consider upgrading Node to >= v20.19.0 (or 22.12+) to satisfy `execa`/`vite` engine ranges and silence warnings.

## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Executed README.md recovery focused on Sprint 2 work.
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized command preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 or hostname/user/pwd) in `src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts`.
- Updated Sprint 2 task statuses (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-2.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-3.md`).

**Current Project State:**
- TSRanger now renders with one empty line above preview and one between preview and footer; footer uses blue background with white text and fills width.
- Preview line is prefixed by prompt derived from `$PS1` or synthesized `[hostname] user@pwd`.

**Next Steps:**
- Add/adjust tests for scripted preview spacing and prompt logic; run full test suite and collect QA feedback.

## 2025-08-09 (later)

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery from README and verified Sprint 2 Task 7 (prompt-line editing with cursor and shell-like completion).
- Implemented controller prompt editing, tab completion, and view cursor rendering; synchronized filters via model.
- Added/updated tests: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.cursor.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.prompt.test.ts`.
- Ran full test suite: all tests passing.

**Current Project State:**
- Task 7 implementation complete and under QA review.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to QA review for Task 7, then mark Done upon approval.

## 2025-08-10

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery using the default policy (Recover from README). Validated alignment with README's Optimized Recovery Procedure.
- Reviewed sprint plans and QA logs; consolidated current project state below.

**Current Project State:**
- Branch: local behind remote by 2 commits (fast-forward available).
- Sprint 1: Task 1 (tssh wrapper/backend) open.
- Sprint 2: Core tasks delivered (navigation, completion, docs column, footer/prompt). Planning shows 1.5, 1.6, 6, 7 open; code/logs indicate 7 implemented and tests passing; planning needs sync.
- Sprint 3: All tasks open (not started).
- Sprint 4: Devcontainer tasks open (not started).
- Sprint 5: Architecture tasks (1–3) complete; implementation/testing tasks (4–6) pending under src.v2.
- Sprint 6: Versioned folder migration plan defined; all tasks open.
- QA Feedback: Logged in qa-feedback-log.md; no unresolved critical blockers captured.

**Next Steps:**
- Sync Sprint 2 planning checkboxes for Task 7 status and tests.
- Proceed with Sprint 5 implementation tasks (v2) and validate via non-interactive tests (`tsranger test`).
- Fast-forward local branch to remote if appropriate.

## 2025-08-10T08:54:29Z

- Recovered from branch README; journal entry created at scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-10-0854.
- Environment: Docker OK; Node v24.5.0; npm 11.5.2; devcontainer/PlantUML/Graphviz not installed.
- Tests: 7 failing (oosh-completion.shell:3, tsranger.promptline.behavior:4); others passing.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix oosh-completion.sh POSIX issues; sync TSRanger prompt method token; consider devcontainer tooling.
