# Recovery Log

## 2025-08-04

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery as per README.md procedure.
- Read project purpose, tech stack, and management principles.
- Indexed all markdown files and their roles in `index.md`.
- Aggregated QA feedback in `qa-feedback-log.md` (none found in this repo).
- Referenced all role process files for recovery checklists.
- Summarized sprints and tasks (see `scrum.pmo/sprints/initialization.md`, `sprint-0/planning.md`, and `sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Checked for broken links, missing backlinks, and outdated templates (none found in indexed files).
- No recovery issues or gaps detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with Sprint 1, Task: Add tssh shell wrapper and backend (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-1/task-tssh-wrapper.md`).
- Ensure all acceptance criteria for tssh are met and documented.

## 2025-08-06

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Regenerated markdown index with roles and dates (`index.md`).
- Aggregated QA feedback into `qa-feedback-log.md` from sprint/task QA sections.
- Reviewed role process checklists for alignment; no blocking gaps detected.
- Performed a basic pass for local link targets in markdown; no obvious breakages detected in referenced artifacts.

**Current Project State:**
- TypeScript ESM execution via ts-node is failing in tests (ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION) and tssh CLI behavior not yet implemented to spec.
- Documentation and sprint/task structure are present and linked.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Sprint 1 Task 1: tssh shell wrapper and `TSsh.ts` backend, including `installCompletion()`.
- Fix ts-node ESM invocation for completion backend in shell and tests (use `--esm` and TS_NODE_PROJECT consistently).
- Ensure tests in `/test` pass and update docs if interfaces change.

**Role:** Scrum Master (autonomous). Will coordinate Developer/Tester tasks to address the above.

## 2025-08-08

**Summary:**
- Planned Sprint 2 to deliver a ranger-like interactive shell leveraging `TSCompletion` and `DefaultCLI`.
- Added planning and tasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/`.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Sprint 2 starting with Architect spec, then TUI core, completion integration, and execution bridge.

## 2025-08-08 (later)

**Summary:**
- Followed README.md recovery guidance to proceed autonomously.
- Added Sprint 2 task to refactor `TSRanger` into one class per TS file.
- Completed the refactor by extracting `RangerModel`, `RangerView`, and `RangerController` into separate files and wiring via `TSRanger`.

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests and ensure no regressions. Address any issues if they arise.

## 2025-08-08 (merge verification and Sprint 3 QA review)
## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 / fallback `[hostname] user@pwd`).
- Fixed selected-row alignment across all columns by padding before applying ANSI styles.
- Added resize-aware rendering to keep footer anchored at the bottom with required blank lines.
- Verified via scripted `tsranger` test sequences.

**Next Steps:**
- Write E2E tests per `task-1.5` and PO user guide per `task-1.6`.


**Summary:**
- Performed recovery per README procedure and validated merge health.
- Ran clean install (npm ci) and full test suite: 7 files passed, 35 tests passed, 1 skipped; no failures.
- Observed Node engine warnings for `execa` and `vite` with current Node v20.4.0; functionality unaffected.
- Reviewed `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-3/planning.md`: all tasks present and currently unchecked; no Sprint 3 delivery yet to QA.

**Current Project State:**
- Core CLI and completion features remain green per tests; no post-merge regressions detected.
- Sprint 3 work (GitScrumProject templating, submodule integration, release/recovery automation, tests, docs) is pending.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Sprint 3 Task 1.0 (Architect spec) then proceed to scaffold and submodule integration tasks.
- Consider upgrading Node to >= v20.19.0 (or 22.12+) to satisfy `execa`/`vite` engine ranges and silence warnings.

## 2025-08-09

**Summary:**
- Executed README.md recovery focused on Sprint 2 work.
- Implemented Sprint 2 Task 2 (footer spacing and colorized command preview) and Task 3 (prompt from $PS1 or hostname/user/pwd) in `src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts`.
- Updated Sprint 2 task statuses (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-2.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-3.md`).

**Current Project State:**
- TSRanger now renders with one empty line above preview and one between preview and footer; footer uses blue background with white text and fills width.
- Preview line is prefixed by prompt derived from `$PS1` or synthesized `[hostname] user@pwd`.

**Next Steps:**
- Add/adjust tests for scripted preview spacing and prompt logic; run full test suite and collect QA feedback.

## 2025-08-09 (later)

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery from README and verified Sprint 2 Task 7 (prompt-line editing with cursor and shell-like completion).
- Implemented controller prompt editing, tab completion, and view cursor rendering; synchronized filters via model.
- Added/updated tests: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.cursor.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.prompt.test.ts`.
- Ran full test suite: all tests passing.

**Current Project State:**
- Task 7 implementation complete and under QA review.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to QA review for Task 7, then mark Done upon approval.

## 2025-08-09 (Sprint 4 planning)

**Summary:**
- Performed autonomous recovery per README procedure.
- Reviewed sprint planning templates and existing sprints; aligned Sprint 4 with MAIN/SUBTASK conventions.
- Created `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/requiremnents.md` with UUIDs.
- Added MAIN Task 1 and six role-specific subtasks under `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/`.
- Updated `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/planning.md` to reference MAIN task and subtasks with correct numbering.

**Current Project State:**
- Sprint 4 is fully planned and traceable; execution not yet started.

**Next Steps:**
- Start Task 1.1 (Architect spec), then proceed through DevOps, Tester, PO, and ScrumMaster subtasks.

## 2025-08-09 (DevContainer work)

**Summary:**
- Performed recovery per README. Switched to `feat/sprint-4-devcontainer-planning-pr` and reviewed Sprint 4 tasks and requirements.
- Created `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` with Node 18, Graphviz, and PlantUML CLI; set `TS_NODE_PROJECT` and PATH for terminals.
- Added CI workflow `.github/workflows/devcontainer-validate.yml` to build the devcontainer and run `npm test` and `plantuml -checkonly`.
- Updated `README.md` with DevContainer usage; added PlantUML scripts to `package.json`.
- Marked Sprint 4 Task 1 and subtasks 1.1/1.2 as In Progress.

**Current Project State:**
- Local environment lacks Docker/Graphviz/PlantUML; devcontainer and CI will provide standardized environment.
- Test suite currently has 4 failing tests in `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`; these failures are unrelated to containerization and will persist inside the container until addressed by Sprint 2/3 scope.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete Task 1.1 review of the spec; proceed with Task 1.3 PlantUML/Graphviz validation inside the container and update artifacts.
- Run the CI workflow on PR to validate the devcontainer.
