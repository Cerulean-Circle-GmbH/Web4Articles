   - Node.js: v22.16.0 ✓
   - npm: v10.9.2 ✓
   - PlantUML: NOT INSTALLED
   - Graphviz: NOT INSTALLED

2. **Project Analysis:**
   - Found extensive recovery analysis work in `recovery.analysis/` directory
   - Latest activity: Sprint 8 (empty directory)
   - Most recent PDCA: 2025-08-19 - PDCA reporting clarification
   - Key learning: PDCAs should be comprehensive in files with only dual links in chat

3. **Actions Taken:**
   - Updated recovery.md with timestamped recovery entry
   - Updated index.md with all new markdown files (added 30 new entries)
   - Documented missing DevOps tools as impediments

   - Recovery process has been significantly improved with v4 documentation

## Next Steps
- Address missing DevOps tools (Docker, PlantUML, Graphviz)
- Create Sprint 8 planning structure if needed
- Continue following PDCA reporting pattern: comprehensive content in files, dual links in chat
