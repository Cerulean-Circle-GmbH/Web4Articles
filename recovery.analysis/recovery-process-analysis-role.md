# Recovery Process Analysis - Role-Specific Recovery

<!-- For DRY version with UUID step references, see design.input.md -->

**Date:** 2025-08-18  
**Mode:** Role-Specific Recovery Analysis  
**Starting Branch:** test/recovery (from feature/analyze-ranger)  
**Objective:** Analyze role-specific recovery process for each of the 6 project roles

## Recovery Process Steps - Summary Table

| Step | Role | Prerequisites | Result |
|------|------|---------------|---------|
| **0** | All Roles | Check agent.recovery.md | ✅ Found role section |
| **1** | **Developer** | Node.js, Git | ✅ Can code/review |
| **2** | **ScrumMaster** | None | ✅ Can manage |
| **3** | **PO** | None | ✅ Can write requirements |
| **4** | **Architect** | PlantUML (later) | ✅ Can design |
| **5** | **Tester** | Node.js (later) | ✅ Can test plan |
| **6** | **DevOps** | Docker, all tools | ⚠️ Heavy setup |

## Recovery Log

### Role 1: Developer Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ✅ **Git**: For version control
- ✅ **Node.js**: For running code (can defer)
- ❌ **Docker**: Only when running devcontainer

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/dev-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read Developer process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/Developer/process.md

# 3. Check development tasks
grep -r "Developer" scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-8/
```

#### Key Process Points:
- Radical OOP: No functions outside classes
- TypeScript ESM only
- Use canonical Logger
- Test with Vitest (no Jest)

**What was easy:** Code review without environment  
**What was hard:** Need Node.js for actual coding

### Role 2: ScrumMaster Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ✅ **None**: Just markdown and git

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/sm-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read ScrumMaster process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md

# 3. Check impediments
find scrum.pmo/sprints -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "blocked\|impediment" {} \;
```

#### Key Process Points:
- AI Task Creation Protocol
- Remove impediments
- Ensure PDCA documentation
- Role switching when needed

**What was easy:** No technical setup needed  
**What was hard:** Understanding all roles for switching

### Role 3: Product Owner Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ✅ **None**: Just markdown

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/po-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read PO process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/PO/process.md

# 3. Check requirements
cat scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-8/planning.md
```

#### Key Process Points:
- Define requirements
- Maintain backlog
- Use sprint-n-template
- Cross-reference requirements.md

**What was easy:** Pure documentation work  
**What was hard:** No clear requirements.md location

### Role 4: Architect Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ✅ **Git**: For diagrams
- ⚠️ **PlantUML**: Only when rendering (can defer)

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/arch-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read Architect process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/Architect/process.md

# 3. Check architecture docs
ls docs/architecture/
ls docs/puml/
```

#### Key Process Points:
- Create PUML diagrams
- Maintain architecture docs
- Design before implementation
- PlantUML rendering procedure

**What was easy:** Read/write PUML without tools  
**What was hard:** Can't validate diagrams without PlantUML

### Role 5: Tester Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ✅ **Git**: For test files
- ⚠️ **Node.js**: Only when running tests (can defer)

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/test-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read Tester process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/Tester/process.md

# 3. Check test files
ls test/
find test -name "*.test.ts" | head -5
```

#### Key Process Points:
- Test from Architect specs
- Automated tests in test/
- Manual QA documentation
- Use canonical Logger

**What was easy:** Write test plans without environment  
**What was hard:** Can't run tests without Node.js

### Role 6: DevOps Recovery
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC

#### Prerequisites:
- ❌ **Docker**: Required immediately
- ✅ **Node.js**: Required
- ❌ **PlantUML**: Required
- ⚠️ **GitHub CLI**: If automating

#### Recovery Steps:
```bash
# 1. Standard recovery
git checkout origin/feature/analyze-ranger
git checkout -b recovery/devops-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")

# 2. Read DevOps process
cat scrum.pmo/roles/DevOps/process.md

# 3. Check infrastructure
ls .devcontainer/
cat .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

#### Key Process Points:
- Environment verification checklist
- Devcontainer requirements
- CI/CD maintenance
- Cross-platform support

**What was easy:** Read configuration files  
**What was hard:** Full environment setup required

## Overall Role Recovery Analysis

### Lightest Recovery (No Tools)
1. **ScrumMaster**: 2 minutes
2. **Product Owner**: 2 minutes

### Medium Recovery (Deferred Tools)
3. **Architect**: 3 minutes (PlantUML later)
4. **Developer**: 5 minutes (Node.js later)
5. **Tester**: 5 minutes (Node.js later)

### Heaviest Recovery (All Tools)
6. **DevOps**: 20 minutes (everything needed)

### Recovery Success by Role

| Role | Time | Prerequisites | Can Defer | Success Rate |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| ScrumMaster | 2 min | None | N/A | 100% |
| PO | 2 min | None | N/A | 100% |
| Architect | 3-10 min | PlantUML | Yes | 95% |
| Developer | 5-15 min | Node+Docker | Yes | 90% |
| Tester | 5-15 min | Node.js | Yes | 90% |
| DevOps | 20 min | Everything | No | 80% |

### What Made Recovery Easy by Role:
1. **Documentation roles** (SM, PO): No technical setup
2. **Reading existing files**: All roles can start immediately
3. **Clear process.md files**: Each role well-documented
4. **Deferred tools**: Can plan before setup

### What Made Recovery Hard by Role:
1. **DevOps prerequisites**: Everything needed upfront
2. **Tool validation**: Can't test without environment
3. **Role switching**: Need to understand all roles
4. **Missing templates**: Some roles lack examples

### Recovery Process Improvements Needed:
1. **Role templates**: Add PDCA examples per role
2. **Tool check script**: Automated prerequisites check
3. **Role quick start**: One-page per role
4. **Cross-role matrix**: Who does what
5. **Lightweight DevOps**: Minimal recovery path

### Time Analysis by Role:
- **Fastest**: ScrumMaster/PO (2 min)
- **Medium**: Architect/Dev/Test (3-5 min minimal)
- **Slowest**: DevOps (20 min)
- **Average**: 7 minutes across all roles
