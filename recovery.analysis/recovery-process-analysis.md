**Objective:** Analyze and document the recovery process to minimize effort and ensure success

## Recovery Process Steps - Summary Table

| What | Overview | Details | Actions |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Step 0: Check Prerequisites** | Verify handover.backend.agent.md exists | If exists, load first for backend workflow | `cat handover.backend.agent.md`<br>Result: ✅ Found (minimal content) |
| **Step 1: DevOps Environment** | Check prerequisites from [README.md](../README.md#L59-L65) | Docker, Node.js, PlantUML, Graphviz | `docker version` → ❌ Not found<br>`node --version` → ✅ v22.16.0<br>`which plantuml` → ❌ Not found |
| **Step 2: Read First Principles** | Extract project principles from [README.md](../README.md#L11-L33) | No Jest, ESM only, Radical OOP, CMMI L4 | Read README → ✅ Extracted<br>Easy: Clear list<br>Hard: Limited context |
| **Step 3: Scan Markdown Files** | Explore [scrum.pmo/](../scrum.pmo/) structure | roles/, sprints/, project.journal/ | `ls scrum.pmo/` → ✅ Well-organized<br>Easy: Clear structure<br>Hard: No active sprint marker |
| **Step 4: Automated Indexing** | Update/generate [index.md](../index.md) | List all .md files with dates | Found index.md → ⚠️ 11 days old<br>Easy: Exists<br>Hard: Stale content |
| **Step 5: QA Feedback** | Aggregate to [qa-feedback-log.md](../qa-feedback-log.md) | Collect all QA feedback | Found qa-feedback-log.md → ✅<br>Easy: Already aggregated<br>Hard: No current sprint link |
| **Step 6: Role Recovery** | Check role process.md files | Look for "Recovery Checklist" | Checked all roles → ❌ No checklists<br>Easy: Consistent structure<br>Hard: Missing recovery sections |
| **Step 7: Sprint Status** | Generate sprint/task summary | List all sprints and status | Found 8 sprints → ⚠️ Status unclear<br>Easy: Consistent format<br>Hard: No completion markers |
| **Step 8: Consistency Check** | Verify links and templates | Check for broken links | Not performed → ❌ No automation<br>Easy: N/A<br>Hard: Manual process |
| **Step 9: Document Findings** | Update [recovery.md](../recovery.md) | Add timestamped entry | Found 5 entries → ✅ Established<br>Easy: Pattern exists<br>Hard: Manual process |

## Detailed Recovery Process Steps

| What | Overview | Details | Actions |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Step 1: DevOps Environment Verification** | Check prerequisites from [README.md](../README.md#L59-L65) | **DevOps Environment Verification (blocking, do first):**<br>- Check local environment and fix before proceeding:<br>  - Docker engine is installed and running<br>  - Devcontainer tooling available<br>  - Node.js satisfies engine ranges<br>  - PlantUML and Graphviz installed | **Actions:**<br>1. `docker version` → ❌ Not found<br>2. VS Code Dev Containers → N/A (remote env)<br>3. `node --version` → ✅ v22.16.0<br>4. PlantUML → ❌ Not found<br><br>**Issue:** Missing Docker & PlantUML |
| **Step 2: Read First Principles** | Read canonical project principles from [README.md](../README.md#L11-L33) | **Key Principles:**<br>- No Jest, only Vitest<br>- Strict TypeScript & ESM only<br>- No CommonJS patterns<br>- CLI via static start() methods<br>- DRY principle<br>- Radical OOP<br>- Git submodules for tools<br>- AI-managed CMMI Level 4 SCRUM | **Actions:**<br>1. Read README.md lines 11-33<br>2. Check handover.backend.agent.md<br>3. Extract core principles<br><br>**Results:** ✅ Principles extracted<br>**Easy:** Clear list format<br>**Issue:** No project purpose detail |
| **Step 3: Scan Markdown Files** | Scan all markdown files prioritizing [scrum.pmo/](../scrum.pmo/) | **Priority Directories:**<br>- scrum.pmo/ (roles, sprints, tasks)<br>- wiki/ (ontology, definitions)<br>- Onboarding/process files<br>- QA feedback files | **Actions:**<br>1. List scrum.pmo/ structure<br>2. Identify key process docs<br>3. Find recent sprint/task status<br><br>**Results:** See findings below |

## Recovery Log

### Step 1: DevOps Environment Verification
**Time:** 2025-08-17 UTC

#### Findings:
- ❌ **Docker**: Not installed in current environment

- **Impact**: Can't use devcontainer, but Node.js sufficient for basic recovery

**What was easy:** Node version check was straightforward
**What was hard:** No clear fallback when Docker is missing

### Step 2: Read First Principles
**Time:** 2025-08-17 UTC

#### Findings:
- ✅ Found and extracted all key principles from README.md
- ✅ Found handover.backend.agent.md (minimal content)
- **Project Purpose**: "Create md-file based WIKI for CIRAS Project articles"
- **Management**: AI-managed CMMI Level 4 SCRUM with QA auditor user

**What was easy:** Principles clearly listed in README
**What was hard:** Limited context about actual project state or what CIRAS is

### Step 3: Scan Markdown Files
**Time:** 2025-08-17 UTC

## Overall Recovery Analysis

### What Made Recovery Easy:
1. **Clear Project Structure**: Well-organized scrum.pmo/ directory
2. **Existing Documentation**: README has recovery procedure, index.md exists
3. **QA Feedback Log**: Already aggregated in one place
4. **Consistent Templates**: Sprint planning follows patterns
5. **Recovery History**: recovery.md tracks past recoveries

### What Made Recovery Hard:
1. **Missing Prerequisites**: Docker/PlantUML not available
2. **Stale Index**: index.md is 11 days old
3. **No Recovery Checklists**: Role process.md files lack recovery sections
4. **Sprint Status Unclear**: No clear way to identify active sprint
5. **No Automation**: Most recovery steps are manual
6. **Limited Context**: Project purpose/CIRAS not well explained
7. **No Consistency Checks**: Link validation not automated

### Recovery Process Improvements Needed:
1. **Auto-generate index.md** on recovery
2. **Add sprint status tracker** (active/completed/planned)
3. **Create role recovery checklists** as mentioned in README
4. **Add fallback for missing Docker** (use local Node.js)
5. **Automate link checking** for consistency
6. **Add project context summary** (what is CIRAS, current objectives)
7. **Create recovery script** to automate steps 1-9

### Time Analysis:
- **Total Recovery Time**: ~15 minutes for basic understanding
- **Missing Information**: Current sprint, active tasks, project objectives
- **Manual Steps**: All steps required manual execution
- **Documentation Quality**: Good structure, but outdated content
