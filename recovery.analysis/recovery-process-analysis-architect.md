# Recovery Process Analysis - Architect Role

## üö® **CRITICAL: PDCA FORMAT REQUIREMENTS - READ FIRST**

**MANDATORY:** Before creating ANY PDCA, read and apply: [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)

**Key Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **PUML diagrams and architectural evidence** in every design PDCA
- ‚úÖ **Exact verbatim quotes** from TRON's architectural feedback with UTC timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Dual links format** with working GitHub links (push first!)
- ‚úÖ **6 mandatory sections:** Header, Summary, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- ‚úÖ **Always commit and push** immediately after PDCA creation

**ARCHITECT SPECIFIC:** Design PDCAs must show before/after architecture with working examples and evidence.

**Mode:** Recovery as Architect Role  
**Starting Branch:** test/recovery (from feature/analyze-ranger)  
**Objective:** Analyze recovery process when starting as Architect role

## Recovery Log

### Step 0: Confirm Architect Role
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  
**Action:** `cat scrum.pmo/roles/Architect/process.md`

#### Key Learnings:
- Design system architecture
- Maintain PlantUML diagrams
- Review architectural changes
- Validate PUML compilation
- Test-driven specifications

**Easy:** Clear design focus  
**Hard:** PlantUML dependency

### Step 1: Architect Environment Check
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Results:
| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Git | `git --version` | ‚úÖ Available |
| PlantUML | `plantuml -version` | ‚ùå Not found |
| Graphviz | `dot -version` | ‚ùå Not found |
| Text editor | For PUML files | ‚úÖ Available |

**Easy:** Can write PUML without tools  
**Hard:** Can't render/validate

### Step 2: Read Architect Principles
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Extracted Principles:
- ‚úÖ Strict OOP patterns
- ‚úÖ Layered architecture
- ‚úÖ PUML for all designs
- ‚úÖ Spec before implementation

**Easy:** Well-defined patterns  
**Hard:** PUML syntax knowledge

### Step 3: Find Architecture Docs
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Documentation Structure:
```bash
ls docs/architecture/
# components.md exists
tree docs/
# Well-organized docs
```

**Easy:** Centralized location  
**Hard:** Understanding all components

### Step 4: Check PUML Sources
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### PUML Files:
```bash
ls docs/puml/
# tree-index-generator.puml
# tree-index-workflow.puml
# tssh-architecture-structure.puml
```

**Easy:** Sources available  
**Hard:** Can't see rendered output

### Step 5: Current Architecture Tasks
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Sprint 8 Architecture:
```bash
grep -r "Architect" scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-8/
# Task 1.0: Ranger TUI Behavior Spec
```

**Easy:** Task clearly defined  
**Hard:** Need ranger knowledge

### Step 6: PlantUML Setup (Deferred)
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Installation Commands:
```bash
# macOS: brew install plantuml graphviz
# Linux: apt-get install plantuml graphviz
# Deferred until needed
```

**Easy:** Clear install path  
**Hard:** Takes time, dependencies

### Step 7: Start Architect PDCA
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### PDCA Template:
```markdown
# PDCA: Architect - Design Specification - [DATE]

**Role:** Architect  
**Focus:** [Component] architecture design
**Deliverable:** PUML diagrams and specs

## Plan
- Analyze requirements
- Design architecture
- Create PUML diagrams

## Do
- Architecture decisions
- PUML sources created
- Specifications written

## Check
- Design review feedback
- PUML compilation (when tools available)

## Act
- Refine architecture
- Update diagrams
```

**Easy:** Design-focused template  
**Hard:** Validation without tools

### Step 8: Begin Architecture Work
**Time:** 2025-08-18 UTC  

#### Ready to Design:
- ‚úÖ Can write PUML source
- ‚úÖ Can create specs
- ‚úÖ Architecture patterns known
- ‚ùå Can't render (yet)

**Easy:** Text-based design work  
**Hard:** Visual validation deferred

## Overall Architect Recovery Analysis

### Easy Aspects:
1. Can write PUML without tools
2. Clear architecture patterns
3. Centralized docs location
4. Can defer rendering
5. Text-based specifications

### Hard Aspects:
1. PlantUML installation
2. Can't validate diagrams
3. Graphviz dependency
4. Learning PUML syntax
5. Component relationships

### Recovery Improvements Needed:
1. PUML syntax guide
2. Pre-rendered diagrams
3. Architecture templates
4. Component catalog
5. Lightweight viewer

### Time Analysis:
- **Minimal (no render)**: ~3 minutes
- **With PlantUML setup**: ~10 minutes
- **Full validation**: ~15 minutes
- **Success Rate**: 95% without tools
