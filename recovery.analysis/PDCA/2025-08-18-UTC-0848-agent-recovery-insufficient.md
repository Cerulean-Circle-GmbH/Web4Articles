# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Agent Recovery Insufficient - 2025-08-18-UTC-0848**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-18-UTC-0848  
**🎯 Objective:** Fix agent.recovery.md to actually enable agent recovery  
**👤 Role:** Developer (Agent Recovery Testing)  
**🚨 Issues:** Current agent.recovery.md too minimal - agent can't understand roles or PDCAs

## **✅ Summary**

**📊 QA Decisions**
- [x] Identified critical missing information
- [x] Need PDCA examples and role explanation
- [x] Need testing strategy for agent recovery
- [x] Must include actual recovery steps

## **📋 Plan**

### **Missing Elements**
1. What PDCAs are and how to write them
2. How to identify your role
3. Example PDCA structure
4. How to find next task
5. Testing strategy without spawning agents

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Analysis of Current File**
Current agent.recovery.md has:
- Project name ✓
- Git commands ✓
- Structure ✓

Missing:
- PDCA explanation ✗
- Role identification ✗
- Work process ✗
- Example templates ✗

### **Testing Challenge**
I cannot spawn agents to test recovery. Need alternative approach.

## **🔍 Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Input**: "are you sure you can undertand how to write a pdca and in which role you are after reading this file? /workspace/recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.md i doubt that. look at /workspace/recovery.analysis/recovery-process-analysis.md this was needet do make you aware of writing pdcas and journal entries. the design process shall streamline it to now overwhelm you but you have noc chance to recover from /workspace/recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.md we also need to start thinking about how we can tast this, as you yourself cannot spawn agents. or can you?"  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-18-UTC-0848

### **Critical Realization**
You're right - an agent reading current file would:
- Not know what a PDCA is
- Not know their role
- Not know how to document work
- Be lost immediately

---

## **⚡ Act**

### **Immediate Fix Needed**
Must add:
1. PDCA template with example
2. Role identification process
3. Minimum viable work process
4. Testing methodology

### **Testing Options**
Since I can't spawn agents:
1. Simulate recovery mentally
2. Create test checklist
3. Ask you to test with new agent
4. Document expected outcomes

---

## **🎯 PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Agent recovery must include enough context to understand the work process, not just project structure.

**Process Enhancement**: Include PDCA template and role explanation in agent recovery.

**Quality Impact**: Without this, agents cannot actually recover and work productively.

---

## **📝 One-Line Summary**
Current agent.recovery.md too minimal - agents can't understand PDCAs or roles from it; need to add work process explanation and create testing strategy since I cannot spawn agents.

Agent Recovery Now Actually Usable!
You were absolutely right - the previous version was useless. Now agent.recovery.md includes:
✅ Essential Elements Added:
Role Identification - 6 roles with descriptions
PDCA Template - Complete example ready to use
How to Write PDCAs - 5 key rules with memory references
Finding Tasks - Commands to locate current work
Recovery Process - Step-by-step what to do
Stuck Recovery - Reset commands and help
📊 Comparison:
Before: 50 lines, no PDCA info, no roles
After: 115 lines with everything needed
🧪 Testing Strategy:
Since I cannot spawn agents, I created agent.recovery.test-strategy.md with:
Mental simulation checklist
Required knowledge validation
Human-assisted testing protocol
Success criteria
🔗 Key Files:
Improved Agent Recovery:
GitHub | recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.md
Test Strategy:
GitHub | recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.test-strategy.md
Now an agent reading this file can actually:
Understand what a PDCA is
Create one from the template
Know their role options
Find current work
Start being productive
Would you like to test this with a fresh agent to see if it works? 1
