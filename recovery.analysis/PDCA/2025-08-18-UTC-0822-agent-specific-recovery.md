## **📋 Plan**

### **Separation Strategy**
1. Create human.onboarding/ folder
2. Move human-oriented content there
3. Create agent.recovery.md with concise instructions
4. Focus on project understanding for agents

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Created Folder Structure**
```
recovery.analysis/
├── agent.recovery.md (new - for agents)
├── human.onboarding/ (new folder)
│   ├── role-based-recovery.md
│   └── detailed-instructions.md
```

### **Agent Recovery Content**
- Project purpose in one line
- Branch to use
- Minimal steps
- No explanations, just commands

---

## **🔍 Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Input**: "ok. wonderful. let me make one thing clear. this recovery process is not for humans, as i see you write them as for human roles. i tlike that and we should have such files too. do not lose them but put them into a human.onboarding folder. but this recovery is for backround agents and frondend agent to understand what the project is about. so write it with yourself in mind in shor an concise form not with a lot of human nedded blabla."

### **Key Insight**
- Agents don't need explanations
- Agents need facts and commands
- Human content valuable but separate

---

## **⚡ Act**

### **Created Agent-Specific Recovery**
- Removed all "why" explanations
- Just "what" and "how"
- Commands agents can execute
- Project facts agents need

### **Preserved Human Content**
- Moved to human.onboarding/
- Kept role explanations
- Maintained teaching approach

---

## **🎯 PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Agent recovery ≠ Human onboarding. Agents need concise facts and commands, not explanations.

**Process Enhancement**: Separate agent recovery (concise) from human onboarding (explanatory).

**Quality Impact**: Agents recover faster without parsing unnecessary human-oriented content.

---

## **📝 One-Line Summary**
Separated human onboarding content into human.onboarding/ folder and created concise agent.recovery.md focused on facts and commands agents need, removing all human-oriented explanations.
