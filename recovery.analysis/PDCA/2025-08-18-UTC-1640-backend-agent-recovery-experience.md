# PDCA: Backend Agent Recovery Experience

**Date:** 2025-08-18 UTC 16:40  
**Agent:** Backend Agent  
**Topic:** Recovery Process Execution and Improvement

## Plan

**Objective:** Execute recovery process as documented in README.md to regain project context and identify next tasks.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Understand project state and my role
- Identify current sprint and tasks
- Determine immediate next steps
- Document recovery process

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete all recovery checklist items
- Identify failing tests or blockers
- Update project documentation
- Clear understanding of next actions

## Do

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ DevOps environment verification - Found Node.js v22.16.0, Docker missing (non-blocking)
2. ✅ Checked handover.backend.agent.md - Found minimal but helpful identity confirmation
3. ✅ Scanned 200+ markdown files across project structure
4. ✅ Updated index.md from 2025-08-06 to 2025-08-18 with comprehensive file listing
5. ✅ Verified qa-feedback-log.md was already aggregated (last update 2025-08-10)
6. ✅ Reviewed role process files (no explicit recovery checklists found)
7. ✅ Generated sprint status summary - Sprint 8 planning, Sprint 6 incomplete
8. ✅ Ran test suite - found 4 failing tests in tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts
9. ✅ Documented findings in recovery.md with timestamp

**Time Taken:** ~15 minutes

## Check

**What Worked Well:**
- Clear numbered checklist in README.md provided good structure
- Test suite immediately revealed project health
- Extensive documentation provided rich context
- Project structure well-organized with clear separation of concerns

**What Didn't Work:**
- User's initial request "recover from readme (on test/recover)" was confusing
- 200+ files created information overload
- Missing recovery checklists mentioned in README
- Unclear which sprint is truly "current" with multiple incomplete sprints
- Handover file too minimal

**Gaps Identified:**
- No "Recovery Checklist" sections in role process.md files as referenced
- No current state dashboard or summary
- No prioritization of recent/relevant files during scanning
- Wiki directory empty despite Sprint 0 references

## Act

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Created comprehensive recovery review document
2. Identified next task: Fix 4 failing prompt-line behavior tests

**Process Improvements Needed:**
1. **Create Recovery Checklist Templates** for each role's process.md
   - Current tasks and blockers
   - Recent commits and decisions
   - Known issues specific to role

2. **Implement Current State Dashboard** (CURRENT_STATE.md)
   - Active sprint number and goal
   - Current task in progress with assignee
   - Test suite status summary
   - Last 5 commits with purpose

3. **Enhance Handover Files** with:
   - Current working branch
   - Task context and progress
   - Recent decisions made
   - Specific next steps

4. **Add Recovery Prioritization**
   - Scan files modified in last 7 days first
   - Focus on current sprint files
   - Highlight failed test files
   - Show recent QA feedback

5. **Create Recovery Test Mode**
   - Validate expected files exist
   - Check for required sections
   - Verify test suite is runnable
   - Ensure dependencies are installed

**Long-term Improvements:**
- Automate index.md generation on commit
- Add recovery time tracking to measure efficiency
- Create role-specific recovery paths
- Implement recovery success metrics

## Lessons Learned

1. **Clarity in Instructions:** Users may use imprecise language; the recovery process should be robust to variations
2. **Information Architecture:** Too much information can be as problematic as too little
3. **Living Documentation:** References to non-existent sections (recovery checklists) indicate documentation drift
4. **State Tracking:** Projects need clear, current state indicators for effective handoffs
5. **Test Suite as Truth:** Running tests provides immediate, objective project health assessment

## Next PDCA Cycle

**Topic:** Implement Current State Dashboard  
**When:** After fixing failing tests  
**Goal:** Create automated state tracking for easier future recoveries
