# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Preserve Original and Create Design Input - 2025-08-18-UTC-0719**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-18-UTC-0719  
**üéØ Objective:** Restore original recovery-process-analysis.md and create new design.input.md  
**üë§ Role:** Developer (Documentation Management)  
**üö® Issues:** Overwrote original content instead of creating new file

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] Restore original recovery-process-analysis.md
- [x] Create new design.input.md with DRY improvements
- [x] Add minimal UUID annotations to original
- [x] Preserve original content integrity

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/test/recovery/recovery.analysis/design.input.md) | [recovery.analysis/design.input.md](../design.input.md) (new DRY version)

## **üìã Plan**

### **Recovery Strategy**
1. Save current DRY version to design.input.md
2. Restore original recovery-process-analysis.md from git
3. Add minimal UUID annotations to original
4. Commit both files properly

### **Key Principle**
- Never overwrite analysis files
- Create new design files for improvements
- Preserve original documentation

---

## **üî® Do**

### **File Operations**
1. Copied current content to design.input.md
2. Restored original from git history
3. Added light UUID annotations
4. Maintained original structure

### **Design Separation**
- **recovery-process-analysis.md**: Original analysis (preserved)
- **design.input.md**: DRY improvement design (new)
- **design.recovery.process.md**: Recovery modes design (existing)

## **üîç Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Input**: "i like the ne content /workspace/recovery.analysis/recovery-process-analysis.md but overwriting the old content is not an option. make it an design.input.md file or similar and restore the previous content. maybe annotati it with uuid references but do not really change it!!!"  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-18-UTC-0719

### **Verification**
- ‚úÖ Original content restored
- ‚úÖ New design file created
- ‚úÖ UUID annotations minimal
- ‚úÖ Original structure preserved

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Created design.input.md with DRY version
2. Restored original recovery-process-analysis.md
3. Added light annotations only
4. Committed separation of concerns

### **Lesson Learned**
- Analysis files are historical records
- Design files are for improvements
- Always create new files for redesigns
- Preserve original documentation

### **Next Steps**
- Use design files for future improvements
- Keep analysis files as-is
- Document this pattern for team

---

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Analysis files are historical artifacts that should be preserved. Design improvements belong in separate design files.

**Process Enhancement**: Create design.*.md files for improvements rather than modifying original analysis.

**Quality Impact**: Maintains historical integrity while allowing design evolution.

---

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Restored original recovery-process-analysis.md and moved DRY improvements to new design.input.md file, preserving historical analysis while enabling design evolution.
