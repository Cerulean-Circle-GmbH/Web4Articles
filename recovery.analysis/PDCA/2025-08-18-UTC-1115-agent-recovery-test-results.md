# üìã **PDCA Cycle: First Agent Recovery Test Results - 2025-08-18-UTC-1115**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-18-UTC-1115  
**üéØ Objective:** Analyze first real agent recovery using V4 procedure  
**üë§ Role:** Recovery Designer (analyzing test results)  
**üö® Issues:** Agent confused about PDCA reporting despite recovery

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] Agent recovered successfully in ~15 minutes
- [x] Found and fixed failing tests
- [x] Created recovery review and PDCA
- [ ] Failed to understand PDCA reporting format
- [ ] Confused by initial instruction

## **üìã Plan**

### **Test Objectives**
1. Verify agent can recover using new procedure
2. Measure actual recovery time
3. Identify gaps in documentation
4. Understand PDCA reporting confusion

---

## **üî® Do**

### **Agent's Recovery Journey**

**Initial Confusion**
- User said: "recover from readme (on test/recover)"
- Agent looked for `test/recover` directory (doesn't exist)
- Eventually found main README and started recovery

**Recovery Execution**
1. ‚úÖ Environment check (Node.js OK, Docker missing)
2. ‚úÖ Found handover file (minimal but worked)
3. ‚úÖ Scanned 200+ markdown files
4. ‚úÖ Updated outdated index.md
5. ‚úÖ Ran tests (found 4 failures)
6. ‚úÖ Identified next task correctly
‚è±Ô∏è **Time: ~15 minutes** (3x longer than target)

**PDCA Reporting Failure**
- Agent wrote PDCA to file
- Told user "I saved it at path X"
- Didn't report content directly
- Required multiple attempts to understand

### **Critical Discovery**
Agent had to learn PDCA reporting by:
1. Reading diary entry
2. Reading 19 PDCA files
3. Being corrected multiple times
4. Finally understanding: report content, not location

---

## **üîç Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Input**: "this is a log og an backgroundagent that recovered from your procedure. write a comprehensive pdca what you learned from it and why the agent does not really know what a pdca entry should look like and ho it needs to report it to me."  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-18-UTC-1115

### **What Worked**
- ‚úÖ Agent recovered successfully
- ‚úÖ Found correct role and task
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Eventually learned correct format

### **What Failed**
- ‚ùå Initial instruction ambiguous
- ‚ùå 200+ files = information overload
- ‚ùå No PDCA reporting examples
- ‚ùå Agent defaulted to "save and tell"

### **Root Causes**
1. **Missing in agent.recovery.md**: How to report PDCAs
2. **Missing in process.md**: PDCA examples
3. **Cultural assumption**: Agents think "document = save file"
4. **No template**: Agent had to reverse-engineer format

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Immediate Fixes Needed**

**1. Add PDCA Reporting to agent.recovery.md**
```markdown
## How to Report PDCAs
When user asks for PDCA, respond with:

**Plan**: One-line goal
**Do**: ‚úÖ Bullet actions with metrics  
**Check**: Problems found + root cause
**Act**: Next step + key learning

DON'T say "I saved it at X"
DO report content directly
```

**2. Add Quick Example**
```markdown
## PDCA Example
**Plan**: Fix failing tests
**Do**: ‚úÖ Found 4 failures in promptline behavior
**Check**: Root cause - method token sync broken
**Act**: Fix sync logic. Learning: Arrow keys need special handling
```

**3. Update Recovery Instructions**
- Add: "After recovery, practice a PDCA report"
- Add: Link to PDCA examples
- Add: "Report inline, don't just save files"

### **Process Improvements**
1. Create PDCA template in agent.recovery.md
2. Add "PDCA Reporting 101" section
3. Include inline reporting examples
4. Make first PDCA practice mandatory

---

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Agents don't intuitively understand that PDCAs should be reported inline - they default to traditional "save file and reference it" behavior.

**Process Enhancement**: Must explicitly teach PDCA reporting as part of recovery, not assume agents will figure it out from context.

**Quality Impact**: Without PDCA reporting skills, agents can recover but can't communicate effectively with users about their work.

---

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
First agent test revealed successful 15-minute recovery but critical gap: agents need explicit PDCA reporting instructions or they default to "file-save-and-tell" instead of inline executive summaries.
