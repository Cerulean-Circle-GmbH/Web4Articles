### Already Merged to Main (Candidates for Deletion)
These branches were previously merged into `origin/main`:
- [x] origin/cursor/automate-gitscrum-project-setup-and-management-3bc8
- [x] origin/cursor/get-workspace-tree-eff5
- [x] origin/cursor/review-readme-and-sprint-2-work-5861
- [x] origin/docs/sprint-3-embed-svgs

## Branches Not to Touch
These branches should be preserved:
- **origin/main** — Primary development branch
- **origin/retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro** — Retro branch (historical reference)
- **origin/release/dev** — Nightly CI/CD integration branch

## Key Achievements
1. **Complete Integration**: release/dev now contains all work from all branches
2. **Sprint Discovery**: Found and integrated Sprints 5, 6, and 8
3. **Content Preservation**: All QA feedback and documentation preserved
4. **Task State Machine**: Integrated from test-state-machine branch

## Next Steps
1. Push final integrated state
2. Create release/testing branch (Sprint 9 Task 8)
3. Create release/production branch (Sprint 9 Task 9)
4. Set up automated nightly merges via GitHub Actions
