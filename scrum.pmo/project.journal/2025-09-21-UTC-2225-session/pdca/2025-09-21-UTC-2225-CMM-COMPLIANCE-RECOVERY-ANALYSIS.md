### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1:** Process discipline approach
  - a) Implement mandatory CMM check after every coding session
  - b) Trust developer to self-regulate CMM compliance
- [ ] **Decision 2:** Documentation timing
  - a) Create PDCA before coding to maintain discipline
  - b) Create PDCA after coding with recovery analysis

```quote
cmm4 means a balance between doing and understanding first. you learned code an forgot all about howto pdca. finally you are all cmm1. running arou and losing yourself and everything. read howto cmm and howto pdca ant do one after each prompt
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right. I fell into CMM1 chaos - jumped straight into coding the Web4 auto-build CLI generation fix without maintaining proper process discipline. I got caught up in the technical implementation and forgot the CMM4 principle of balancing doing with understanding. I should have created a PDCA before diving into coding and maintained process awareness throughout. I've now re-read both howto.cmm.md and howto.PDCA.md to restore proper understanding and will create a PDCA after each prompt going forward.

**Learning Applied:** CMM4 requires continuous balance between action and reflection, not periods of pure coding followed by pure documentation.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Problem Analysis:**
- **CMM Level Regression:** Fell from CMM4 (balanced understanding + action) to CMM1 (reactive coding without process)
- **Process Abandonment:** Focused solely on technical implementation without maintaining PDCA discipline
- **Understanding Loss:** Forgot foundational CMM and PDCA principles during coding session
- **Session Fragmentation:** Technical work succeeded but process compliance failed

**Recovery Strategy:**
1. **Re-establish CMM Understanding:** Read and internalize CMM levels and requirements
2. **Restore PDCA Discipline:** Create proper documentation for completed technical work
3. **Implement Process Checks:** PDCA after each prompt as instructed
4. **Balance Maintenance:** Maintain CMM4 equilibrium between doing and understanding

**Success Criteria:**
- Proper understanding of CMM1-4 levels demonstrated
- PDCA created documenting current recovery process
- Commitment to PDCA-per-prompt discipline going forward
- Technical work properly documented with process compliance

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. CMM Understanding Restoration**
**Read and analyzed:**
- `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/howto.cmm.md`
- `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md`

**Key CMM Level Insights:**
- **CMM1 (My Behavior):** Reactive, ad-hoc coding without process understanding
- **CMM2 (Risk Zone):** Template following but with individual variations and interpretations  
- **CMM3 (Minimum):** Objective definitions with scientific reproducibility
- **CMM4 (Target):** Feedback loop mastery with whitebox system understanding
- **CMM5 (Avoid):** Life-critical perfection, economically impossible for normal work

### **2. PDCA Process Understanding**
**Critical Recognition:**
- PDCA is a **CMM4 feedback loop system**, not just documentation
- **Plan:** Design improvement based on whitebox understanding
- **Do:** Execute systematically 
- **Check:** Measure if plan worked AND execution correctness
- **Act:** Address everything that didn't achieve improvement
- **Iteration:** Repeat Check-Act until CMM4 improvement achieved

### **3. Process Discipline Implementation**
**Created this PDCA** documenting:
- Current CMM1 behavior analysis
- Recovery strategy and actions taken
- Commitment to process discipline going forward
- Technical work retrospective with proper documentation

### **4. Technical Work Documentation**
**Previous session achievements** (now properly documented):
- Fixed Web4TSComponent CLI generation inconsistency
- Implemented modern ESM auto-build chain
- Resolved bash/ts-node dependency issues
- Created comprehensive PDCA for technical implementation

## **✅ CHECK**

**CMM Understanding Verification:**
```
✅ CMM Levels: Understood CMM1-5 progression and current position
✅ CMM4 Target: Balance of understanding and action, feedback loop mastery
✅ Process Integration: PDCA as CMM4 system, not documentation template
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"cmm4 means a balance between doing and understanding first. you learned code an forgot all about howto pdca. finally you are all cmm1. running arou and losing yourself and everything. read howto cmm and howto pdca ant do one after each prompt"**

**Recovery Actions Verified**
- ✅ **Understanding Restored:** Read both howto.cmm.md and howto.PDCA.md completely
- ✅ **CMM1 Behavior Acknowledged:** Recognized reactive coding without process discipline
- ✅ **PDCA Discipline Restored:** Created proper PDCA documenting recovery process
- ✅ **Process Commitment:** Will create PDCA after each prompt going forward

**Technical Work Status**
- ✅ **Implementation Success:** Web4 auto-build CLI generation fix working perfectly
- ✅ **Documentation Complete:** Comprehensive technical PDCA created retrospectively
- ✅ **Standards Compliance:** Modern ESM TypeScript, zero-config auto-build achieved

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate Process Changes:**
1. **PDCA After Every Prompt:** Mandatory documentation following each user interaction
2. **CMM4 Balance Maintenance:** Combine understanding with action, never purely one or the other
3. **Process Awareness:** Maintain conscious awareness of CMM level during all work
4. **Technical Integration:** Use PDCA to enhance technical work quality, not just document it

**Long-term Discipline Measures:**
- Create structured approach combining technical implementation with process documentation
- Use PDCA as active improvement tool, not passive reporting
- Maintain whitebox understanding before making changes (CMM4 principle)
- Apply systematic feedback loops to all significant work

**Recovery Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ CMM understanding restored and internalized
- ✅ Process discipline re-established with concrete commitment
- ✅ Technical work properly documented retrospectively
- ✅ Future process compliance framework established

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: PROCESS DISCIPLINE RESTORATION**

### **Humility:**
**PROFOUND** recognition of how easy it is to slip from CMM4 discipline into CMM1 chaos when focused on technical challenges. The balance between understanding and doing requires constant conscious maintenance.

### **Determination:**
**SYSTEMATIC** commitment to maintaining process discipline while delivering technical excellence. CMM4 isn't just about following processes - it's about creating a sustainable balance that improves both work quality and learning.

### **Relief:**
**TREMENDOUS** appreciation for the correction. Without the explicit feedback about CMM regression, I would have continued in CMM1 chaos mode, potentially undermining future work quality despite technical successes.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation after every prompt, not just major work
- ✅ **CMM4 Balance:** Understanding and action must be maintained simultaneously, not sequentially
- ✅ **Process Memory:** Technical focus can cause process memory loss - requires active maintenance
- ✅ **Recovery Framework:** Established systematic approach for restoring process discipline

**Quality Impact:** This recovery ensures all future work maintains CMM4 standards while delivering technical excellence. Process discipline enhances rather than hinders technical capability.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue with current session requirements while maintaining newly restored process discipline. Each subsequent interaction will include proper PDCA documentation.
