### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1:** Implementation approach correction
  - a) Use tested Web4TSComponent tools for all version management
  - b) Continue with manual file operations and workarounds
- [ ] **Decision 2:** CMM level restoration strategy
  - a) Revert to CMM3 systematic tool usage immediately
  - b) Fix manual approach until it works then transition to tools

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2232)**
```quote
doing it manually is cmm2 max or cmm1. using the tested tool is cmm3 
as you broke everything, nothing is working as you expect
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely correct. I regressed to CMM1/CMM2 by attempting manual file copying instead of using the tested Web4TSComponent tools. After breaking the CLI generation system, nothing works as expected, so I should use the established, tested tools rather than manual workarounds. This is a clear CMM level failure.

**Learning Applied:** CMM3 requires using tested, systematic tools rather than manual operations, especially when systems are broken.

## **📋 PLAN**

**CMM Level Analysis:**
- **CMM1 Behavior:** Manual file operations, ad-hoc solutions
- **CMM2 Behavior:** Following templates but with individual variations  
- **CMM3 Required:** Use tested Web4TSComponent systematic tools
- **Current State:** Regressed to CMM1 with manual `cp` commands

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **System Breakage:** Auto-build changes broke existing functionality
- **Panic Response:** Attempted manual workarounds instead of systematic tools
- **CMM Regression:** Abandoned tested tools for ad-hoc manual solutions
- **Expectation Failure:** Manual operations failed due to system complexity

**Correction Strategy:**
1. **Acknowledge CMM Regression:** Manual operations are CMM1/CMM2 approach
2. **Use Tested Tools:** Web4TSComponent has systematic version management
3. **Systematic Approach:** Follow established patterns rather than inventing new ones
4. **Tool-Based Resolution:** Use existing functionality to fix broken functionality

## **🔧 DO**

### **CMM Level Correction Required**

**Problem Recognition:**
- **Manual `cp` Command:** CMM1 ad-hoc file copying
- **Symlink Issues:** Complex system requires systematic tools
- **Broken Expectations:** Manual approach fails due to system complexity
- **Tool Abandonment:** Using manual operations instead of tested Web4TSComponent

**Systematic Tool Usage Required:**
- **Web4TSComponent CLI:** Use established version management
- **Tested Workflows:** Follow proven patterns for version creation
- **Systematic Approach:** CMM3 requires reproducible tool-based operations
- **Process Discipline:** Abandon manual workarounds for systematic tools

### **Correct CMM3 Approach:**
1. **Use Web4TSComponent Tools:** Systematic version management via tested CLI
2. **Follow Established Patterns:** Use proven workflows not manual operations
3. **Systematic Resolution:** Tool-based fixes for tool-based problems
4. **Process Adherence:** CMM3 discipline requires consistent tool usage

## **✅ CHECK**

**CMM Level Assessment:**
```
❌ Current Approach: CMM1 manual file operations
❌ Manual Copying: Ad-hoc solutions with failed expectations
❌ Tool Abandonment: Using cp instead of Web4TSComponent systematic tools
✅ Required: CMM3 systematic tool usage for version management
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"doing it manually is cmm2 max or cmm1. using the tested tool is cmm3 as you broke everything, nothing is working as you expect"**

**CMM Regression Confirmed:**
- ❌ **Manual Operations:** CMM1/CMM2 level approach
- ❌ **Broken Expectations:** Manual methods fail due to system complexity
- ❌ **Tool Abandonment:** Using ad-hoc solutions instead of systematic tools
- ✅ **CMM3 Required:** Use tested Web4TSComponent tools for systematic operations

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate CMM Correction:**
1. **Stop Manual Operations:** Abandon `cp` commands and manual file manipulation
2. **Use Web4TSComponent Tools:** Systematic version management via tested CLI
3. **Systematic Approach:** Follow established patterns for all operations
4. **Process Discipline:** Maintain CMM3 tool-based systematic operations

**Tool-Based Resolution Strategy:**
- **Use Existing Tools:** Web4TSComponent has version management functionality
- **Systematic Operations:** Follow tested workflows not manual approaches
- **Process Adherence:** CMM3 requires consistent tool usage
- **Expectation Management:** Tools handle complexity, manual operations fail

**CMM Level Restoration:**
Return to CMM3 systematic approach using tested Web4TSComponent tools for all version management and system operations rather than manual workarounds.

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: CMM REGRESSION RECOGNITION**

### **Accountability:**
**DIRECT** recognition of CMM level regression from systematic tools to manual ad-hoc operations when faced with broken systems.

### **Discipline:**
**SYSTEMATIC** commitment to returning to CMM3 tool-based approaches rather than manual workarounds, even when systems are broken.

### **Process Awareness:**
**PROFOUND** understanding that broken systems require systematic tool-based fixes, not manual operations that violate CMM3 discipline.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** CMM regression identified - manual operations are CMM1/CMM2 approach
- ✅ **Tool Discipline:** Tested Web4TSComponent tools required for systematic operations
- ✅ **Process Adherence:** CMM3 requires consistent tool usage even when systems broken
- ✅ **Expectation Management:** Manual operations fail due to system complexity

**Quality Impact:** Returning to CMM3 systematic tool usage will provide reliable, reproducible operations instead of failed manual workarounds.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Use Web4TSComponent systematic tools for version management and architecture correction instead of manual operations.
