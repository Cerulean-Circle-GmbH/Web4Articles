### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/0306/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-21-UTC-2225-session/pdca/2025-09-21-UTC-2233-WORKING-TOOLS-ASSESSMENT.md) | [pdca/2025-09-21-UTC-2233-WORKING-TOOLS-ASSESSMENT.md](2025-09-21-UTC-2233-WORKING-TOOLS-ASSESSMENT.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1:** Implementation approach correction  
  - ✅ **1a) Use tested Web4TSComponent tools for all version management** ← SELECTED
  - b) Continue with manual file operations and workarounds
- [x] **Decision 2:** CMM level restoration strategy
  - ✅ **2a) Revert to CMM3 systematic tool usage immediately** ← SELECTED
  - b) Fix manual approach until it works then transition to tools

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2233)**
```quote
1a
2a
any tools that you did not break?
```

### **My Answer**
Decisions 1a and 2a applied - using systematic Web4TSComponent tools immediately for CMM3 restoration. Need to assess which tools are still working after the CLI generation changes to identify reliable systematic approaches for T1-T8 implementation.

**Learning Applied:** Identify working tools before attempting systematic implementation to avoid further CMM regression.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Working Tools Assessment Strategy:**
1. **Web4TSComponent Core Methods:** Check basic functionality that doesn't involve CLI generation
2. **Version Management:** Test if upgrade/creation methods work without broken CLI
3. **Component Analysis:** Verify analysis and comparison tools still function
4. **Build System:** Check if build processes work independently of CLI
5. **File Operations:** Test systematic file operations vs broken CLI generation

**Assessment Approach:**
- **Test Core Methods:** Try basic Web4TSComponent operations
- **Avoid Broken Areas:** Skip CLI generation testing until fixed
- **Identify Working Patterns:** Find reliable systematic approaches
- **Document Findings:** List working vs broken tools for T1-T8 implementation

## **🔧 DO**

### **Tool Assessment - Systematic Testing**

**Testing Working Tools:**

### **Core Web4TSComponent Methods (Not CLI-dependent)**

### **Version Management (If Not CLI-dependent)**

### **Component Analysis Tools**

### **Build System Assessment**

### **Reliable Operations Identification**

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Working Tools Status:**
```
[Will update after testing each tool category]
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"1a 2a any tools that you did not break?"**

**Assessment Framework:**
- ✅ **Decision 1a:** Will use tested Web4TSComponent tools for version management
- ✅ **Decision 2a:** Immediate CMM3 systematic tool usage
- ⚠️ **Tool Assessment:** Need to identify which tools still work reliably
- ⚠️ **Systematic Approach:** Find working tools for T1-T8 implementation

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate Assessment:**
Test core Web4TSComponent functionality to identify working tools that can be used for systematic T1-T8 implementation without relying on broken CLI generation.

**Working Tool Identification:**
Find reliable systematic approaches that avoid broken areas while maintaining CMM3 tool-based discipline.

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: SYSTEMATIC TOOL ASSESSMENT**

### **Caution:**
**METHODICAL** approach to identifying working tools before attempting further implementation to avoid compounding failures.

### **Systematic Approach:**
**DISCIPLINED** commitment to testing tools systematically rather than assuming functionality after breaking changes.

### **Recovery Focus:**
**DETERMINED** effort to find reliable tools for CMM3 implementation while avoiding broken functionality.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Decisions 1a and 2a applied - systematic tool usage for CMM3 restoration
- ✅ **Tool Assessment:** Must identify working tools before attempting systematic implementation
- ✅ **CMM3 Discipline:** Use tested tools rather than assumptions about functionality
- ✅ **Recovery Strategy:** Find working systematic approaches for T1-T8 implementation

**Quality Impact:** Proper tool assessment will identify reliable systematic approaches for implementing T1-T8 corrections without further system breakage.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Test and document working Web4TSComponent tools for systematic T1-T8 implementation.
