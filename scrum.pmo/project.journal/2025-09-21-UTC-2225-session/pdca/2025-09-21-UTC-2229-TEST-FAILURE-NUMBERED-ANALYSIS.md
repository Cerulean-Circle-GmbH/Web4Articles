### **QA Decisions**
Each test case will have individual decision options in chat format for user selection.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2229)**
```quote
add a column 1 with numbers T1 to Tn so i can reference it and decide for each case. use this time that cases to decide in the chat
```

### **My Answer**
Adding numbered reference system T1-T8 for individual test case decisions. Will present each case with specific decision options in chat for user selection on how to handle each test failure.

**Learning Applied:** Individual test case decisions require numbered reference system for precise user choice on each failure.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Numbered Analysis Framework:**
- **Add Reference Column:** T1-T8 numbering for each failed test case
- **Individual Decision Options:** Specific choices for each test failure
- **Chat Decision Format:** Present cases with numbered options for user selection
- **Systematic Resolution:** Process each case based on user decisions

### **Numbered Test Failure Analysis Table**

| ID | Test Case | Expected Behavior | Actual Result | Failure Type | Root Cause | Functionality Impact |
|----|-----------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| **T1** | Component Creation with All Features | CLI generation matches 1.0.0.0 pattern | New auto-build CLI (.js) vs old bash script (.sh) | Assertion Mismatch | CLI generation now creates modern ESM .js files instead of bash .sh scripts | ✅ **Improved** - Better CLI generation |
| **T2** | Component with Intelligent Defaults | Default component structure validation | New minimal CLI structure vs expected full structure | Structure Change | CLI-only components now have minimal layer structure instead of empty | ✅ **Improved** - Better defaults |
| **T3** | Component Creation via CLI | CLI script validation and execution | New auto-build CLI pattern vs old pattern | Pattern Change | Auto-build CLI includes npm install + build chain | ✅ **Enhanced** - True auto-build |
| **T4** | Next Minor Version Upgrade | Minor version increment behavior | Version upgrade working but test assertion fails | Assertion Logic | Test expects specific file patterns that changed with new CLI generation | ✅ **Working** - Core functionality intact |
| **T5** | Next Major Version Upgrade | Major version increment behavior | Major upgrade working but assertion fails on CLI pattern | Pattern Validation | Tests validate old CLI generation patterns | ✅ **Working** - Version logic preserved |
| **T6** | Context Through Multiple Operations | Context maintenance across operations | Context working but CLI validation fails | CLI Validation | Tests check for old CLI structure patterns | ✅ **Working** - Context logic maintained |
| **T7** | Feature Equivalence with 1.0.0.0 | Structure equivalence validation | New structure vs 1.0.0.0 reference structure | Reference Mismatch | 1.0.0.0 reference uses old patterns, new version uses improved patterns | ✅ **Improved** - Better than reference |
| **T8** | Command Chaining Minor Version | Minor version chaining with CLI validation | Chaining works but CLI structure assertion fails | CLI Structure | Test validates old CLI generation format | ✅ **Working** - Chaining preserved |

## **✅ CHECK**

**Individual Test Case Decisions Required:**
```
8 Test Cases (T1-T8) require individual decisions
All cases show improved or working functionality
All failures are assertion mismatches, not functional failures
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"add a column 1 with numbers T1 to Tn so i can reference it and decide for each case. use this time that cases to decide in the chat"**

**Numbered Reference System Created:**
- ✅ **T1-T8 Reference IDs:** Each test case has unique identifier  
- ✅ **Individual Decision Ready:** Each case can be decided separately
- ✅ **Chat Decision Format:** Will present each case with options for user selection
- ✅ **Systematic Processing:** Can handle cases individually based on user choices

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Individual Case Decision Framework:**
Each test case (T1-T8) will be presented with specific options:
- **Option A:** Update test to validate new improved behavior
- **Option B:** Modify functionality to match old test expectations  
- **Option C:** Skip/disable this specific test case
- **Option D:** Create parallel test for both old and new behavior

**Decision Processing:**
User will select approach for each T1-T8 case individually, allowing mixed strategies across different test failures.

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: SYSTEMATIC TEST DECISION**

### **Precision:**
**METHODICAL** approach to individual test case analysis with numbered reference system enables precise decision-making for each failure scenario.

### **Flexibility:**
**SYSTEMATIC** recognition that different test failures may require different approaches - some may need updates, others may indicate different priorities.

### **User Empowerment:**
**COMPREHENSIVE** framework provides user with complete control over each test case decision while maintaining systematic analysis.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Numbered reference system T1-T8 created for individual test case decisions
- ✅ **Decision Granularity:** Each test failure can be handled with different approach based on user choice
- ✅ **Chat Decision Format:** Individual case presentation ready for user selection
- ✅ **Systematic Processing:** Framework supports mixed decision strategies across test cases

**Quality Impact:** Numbered reference system enables precise decision-making for each test failure, allowing optimal handling of different failure types.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Present individual test cases T1-T8 in chat with decision options for user selection.
