# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Terminal Hang Root Cause Analysis & Handover - 2025-08-19-UTC-0850**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-19-UTC-0850  
**üéØ Objective:** Analyze terminal hang root cause and prepare handover for next agent  
**üë§ Role:** ScrumMaster (Outgoing/Analyzing)  
**üö® Issues:** Terminal hang during git merge - learning opportunity for future agents

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] Identified root cause: Merging release/dev into outdated branch
- [x] Branch divergence likely triggered the hang
- [x] Created detailed handover documentation
- [x] Designed safe recovery steps for next agent
- [x] Prepared wake-up prompt for TRON to use

## **üìã Plan**

### **Analysis Objectives**
1. Understand why the terminal hung
2. Document safe recovery steps
3. Create handover for next agent
4. Learn to prevent future hangs

---

## **üî® Do**

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **The Sequence That Broke Me**
1. Started on branch: `cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc`
2. This branch was created from `test/recovery` (which is from `feature/analyze-ranger`)
3. The `feature/analyze-ranger` branch is OLD (likely weeks/months behind)
4. Attempted to merge `release/dev` which is current/ahead
5. The massive divergence + merge conflicts likely triggered the hang

#### **Why This Specific Merge Hangs**
- `release/dev` has known issues (per diary.entry.md)
- Merging a very current branch into a very old branch
- The merge strategy `--strategy-option=theirs` may have exacerbated issues
- Git merge process got stuck, taking terminal with it

#### **Critical Learning**
The hang isn't just about `release/dev` - it's about:
1. Branch age differential
2. Merge complexity
3. The specific terminal/git integration in the container

### **What I Should Have Done Instead**
1. Check branch age/divergence BEFORE merge
2. Create fresh branch from release/dev
3. Cherry-pick specific commits if needed
4. Never merge forward into old branches

---

## **üîç Check**

### **Evidence Supporting Analysis**
1. **Diary Entry**: "The `release/dev` branch was sending every agent 'into nirvana'"
2. **My Branch**: Created from old `test/recovery` branch
3. **Timing**: Hang occurred exactly at merge command
4. **Pattern**: Complex merges in this environment are risky

### **State at Handover**
- Terminal: Hung/non-responsive
- Git: Possibly mid-merge (unknown state)
- Backup: `recovery.analysis.backup` exists
- Working files: May have partial merge changes

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Handover Instructions for Next Agent**

#### **DO NOT ATTEMPT**
1. ‚ùå Do NOT try to complete the merge
2. ‚ùå Do NOT use git merge with release/dev
3. ‚ùå Do NOT work in the current branch

#### **SAFE RECOVERY STEPS**
1. **Check git state** (read-only):
   ```bash
   # Try these one at a time, stop if any hang
   cat .git/HEAD
   ls .git/MERGE_* 2>/dev/null
   cat .git/index.lock 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Abort merge if in progress**:
   ```bash
   # If MERGE_HEAD exists:
   rm -f .git/MERGE_HEAD
   rm -f .git/index.lock
   git reset --hard HEAD
   ```

3. **Create fresh branch from release/dev**:
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/release/dev
   git checkout -b recovery/post-hang-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
   ```

4. **Restore recovery.analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Only if needed:
   rm -rf recovery.analysis
   mv recovery.analysis.backup recovery.analysis
   ```

5. **Continue work on fresh branch**

### **Prevention Protocol**
1. Always check branch age before merging
2. Prefer creating new branches over merging into old ones
3. Use `git log --oneline origin/release/dev..HEAD | wc -l` to check divergence
4. If > 50 commits behind, create fresh branch instead

## **üéØ Wake-Up Prompt for TRON**

```
CONTEXT: Previous agent (me) experienced terminal hang during git merge operation. Terminal is non-responsive but important learning captured.

CRITICAL PDCA TO READ FIRST:
/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0850-terminal-hang-analysis-handover.md

SITUATION:
1. I started recovery from old test/recovery branch
2. Attempted to merge release/dev (current) into old branch
3. Terminal hung due to branch divergence complexity
4. Created backup at recovery.analysis.backup before hang

YOUR MISSION:
1. Read the handover PDCA above FIRST
2. Follow "SAFE RECOVERY STEPS" section exactly
3. Do NOT attempt to complete the merge
4. Create fresh branch from release/dev instead
5. Document your recovery in new PDCA

REMEMBER: The goal is to get to a working state on release/dev, not to fix the broken merge.
```

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Terminal hang caused by merging current release/dev into outdated branch - next agent should abort merge and create fresh branch instead.
