## **üî® Do**

### **Recovery Context Analysis**
- Found existing session: `2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster`

- Latest PDCA emphasized making PDCA reporting mandatory for recovery
- Recovery V4 process requires: Session creation + PDCA + Dual-link reporting

### **Session Status**
- Working in existing session directory (not creating new one)
- Three PDCAs already completed today:
  1. Project status recovery fixes
  2. PDCA reporting clarification
  3. Recovery PDCA minimum achievement

### **Recovery Process Followed**
1. ‚úÖ Checked existing project journal sessions
2. ‚úÖ Found today's ScrumMaster session already exists
3. ‚úÖ Read recent PDCAs to understand context
4. ‚úÖ Read agent.recovery.v4.md for current process

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Next Steps**
1. Review Sprint 8 planning and current impediments
2. Export chat history to maintain continuity
3. Continue ScrumMaster tasks for Sprint 8
4. Update recovery process to clarify session creation rules

### **Process Improvement Note**
User clarified that recovery should "always start a new session if no session was given" - this should be added to recovery documentation for future agents.

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: When specific session is given (like today), use it. When no session specified, create new one.

**Process Enhancement**: Recovery instructions should clarify session creation logic based on whether session is specified.

**Quality Impact**: Clearer recovery process will prevent confusion about when to create vs. use existing sessions.

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Successfully recovered into existing Sprint 8 ScrumMaster session with proper PDCA documentation, ready to continue work and export chat history.
