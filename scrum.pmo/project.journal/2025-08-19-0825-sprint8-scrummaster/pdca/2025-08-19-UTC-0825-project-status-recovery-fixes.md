# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Project Status & Recovery Process Fixes - 2025-08-19-UTC-0825**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-19-UTC-0825  
**üéØ Objective:** Assess project status as ScrumMaster and plan recovery improvements  
**üë§ Role:** ScrumMaster  
**üö® Issues:** Recovery process needs systematic fixes based on test results

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] Identified 3 critical impediments
- [x] Recovery V4 tested - needs communication fixes
- [x] Sprint 8 blocked on test failures
- [ ] Recovery documentation incomplete
- [ ] PDCA reporting not taught to agents

## **üìã Plan**

### **Morning Objectives**
1. Assess overall project health
2. Identify critical impediments
3. Plan recovery process fixes
4. Coordinate sprint 8 progress

---

## **üî® Do**

### **Project Status Assessment**

**Sprint Status**
- Sprint 0: Foundation ‚úÖ Complete
- Sprint 6: Test consolidation ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete
- Sprint 8: Ranger behavior üö´ Blocked

**Critical Impediments Found**
1. **Test Failures**: 4 tests failing in `tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`
   - Blocking: Sprint 8 completion
   - Impact: Can't validate ranger behavior

2. **Recovery Communication Gap**: Agents don't know how to report PDCAs
   - Evidence: Yesterday's test agent saved files instead of reporting
   - Impact: 15+ minute confusion after successful recovery

3. **Branch Strategy Confusion**: Main README updated but other branches still point to hanging recovery
   - Risk: Agents on non-main branches will hang
   - Impact: Potential agent loss

**Team Activity Analysis**
```bash
# Checked recent team activity
ls -lat scrum.pmo/project.journal/*/pdca/*.md | head -10
# Result: High activity on recovery analysis (Aug 18)
# Low activity on actual development tasks
```

## **üîç Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Quote**: "a new Day an new dawn. create a fresh journal entry today and lets start to apply fix the recovery process later systematically. start as scrummaster into the day and give me a project status report and the first pdca of the day. as always short answer in the chat (just links and descisions to be made) and a comprehensive answer in the pdca and std links to the created artefacts in dual fromat. do not forget to quote me in the pdca."  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-19-UTC-0825

### **Health Check Results**
- ‚úÖ Recovery process works (15 min vs 45 min)
- ‚ùå Communication broken (PDCA reporting)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test suite partially failing
- ‚ùå Multi-branch recovery risk

### **Impediment Priority**
1. **P0**: Fix PDCA communication in recovery
2. **P1**: Fix failing tests (blocks sprint 8)
3. **P2**: Update recovery on critical branches

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Immediate Actions (Today)**

**1. Fix Recovery Communication** [Assign: Architect/Developer]
- Update `agent.recovery.md` with PDCA reporting section
- Add inline examples
- Make reporting practice mandatory

**2. Fix Failing Tests** [Assign: Developer/Tester]
- Debug promptline method token sync
- Fix arrow key navigation after tab
- Validate with comprehensive test matrix

**3. Branch Recovery Updates** [Assign: DevOps]
- Update README on `release/dev` (carefully!)
- Update README on `feature/analyze-ranger`
- Create branch protection rules

### **Decisions Needed from QA**
1. Should we merge recovery V4 to main first or fix communication gaps?
2. Priority: Fix tests vs. Fix recovery documentation?
3. Accept 15-minute recovery if communication works?

---

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Testing with real agents revealed that technical recovery success ‚â† communication success.

**Process Enhancement**: All future process changes must include "How to communicate about this" section.

**Quality Impact**: ScrumMaster switching to technical roles today to remove impediments directly.

---

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Project health: Recovery revolution successful but communication broken, Sprint 8 blocked by 4 test failures, immediate fixes needed for PDCA reporting and test suite.
