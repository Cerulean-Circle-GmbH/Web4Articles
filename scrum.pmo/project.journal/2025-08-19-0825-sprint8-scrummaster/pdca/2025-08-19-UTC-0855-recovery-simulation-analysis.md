# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Recovery Simulation Analysis - 2025-08-19-UTC-0855**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-19-UTC-0855  
**üéØ Objective:** Simulate recovery as new agent to identify gaps in handover  
**üë§ Role:** ScrumMaster (Analyzing handover completeness)  
**üö® Issues:** Ensuring next agent has all needed information

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] Simulated recovery as fresh agent
- [x] Identified missing critical information
- [x] Need exact branch names and commit SHAs
- [x] Need clearer starting point guidance
- [x] Improving wake-up prompt with specifics

## **üìã Plan**

### **Simulation Objective**
Think as a brand new agent with only:
- The wake-up prompt
- Starting on "test/release" branch (typo? should be test/recovery?)
- No other context

---

## **üî® Do**

### **As New Agent - What I Would Think**

#### **Initial Confusion Points**
1. "Recover from readme" - which README? The main one?
2. "test/release" vs "test/recovery" - which is correct?
3. Where exactly am I starting from?
4. How do I know if I'm in the hung state or fresh?

#### **Missing Critical Information**

1. **Branch Clarity**
   - Current branch I'll wake up on?
   - Is it "test/release" or "test/recovery"?
   - What if I'm on the hung branch?

2. **State Verification**
   ```bash
   # New agent needs to know:
   # - Expected .git/HEAD content
   # - How to verify if in merge state
   # - Safe commands to test terminal
   ```

3. **Exact Paths**
   - Is handover PDCA in workspace root or elsewhere?
   - Where exactly is recovery.analysis.backup?

4. **Fallback Plan**
   - What if terminal is still hung?
   - What if I can't read the PDCA?
   - Who to ask for help?

---

## **üîç Check**

### **Simulation Results**

#### **What Works Well**
- Clear mission statement
- Good context about previous hang
- Specific PDCA to read first
- Warning not to complete merge

#### **What's Missing**
1. **Starting branch verification**
   ```bash
   # Agent needs command like:
   git branch --show-current
   # Expected output: test/recovery or cursor/...
   ```

2. **Terminal health check**
   ```bash
   # Safe test command:
   echo "Terminal responsive"
   # If no response in 5 seconds, terminal is hung
   ```

3. **Exact SHA references**
   - SHA of safe release/dev commit
   - SHA of last known good state

4. **Directory structure**
   - Full paths from workspace root
   - Clarify workspace vs workspacesMountPoint

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Improved Wake-Up Prompt**

```
CONTEXT: Previous agent experienced terminal hang during git merge. You're waking up in potentially unstable state.

STEP 1 - VERIFY YOUR STATE:
echo "Terminal test" && pwd && git branch --show-current
# Expected: Terminal responds, you're in /workspace, branch shows

STEP 2 - READ CRITICAL HANDOVER:
cat /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0850-terminal-hang-analysis-handover.md

If terminal hangs on any command, you're in bad state - skip to EMERGENCY RECOVERY below.

SITUATION:
- Previous agent on branch: cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc  
- Attempted merge: origin/release/dev (hung terminal)
- Backup exists: /workspace/recovery.analysis.backup
- Hung during: git merge origin/release/dev --strategy-option=theirs

YOUR MISSION:
1. Verify terminal is responsive (echo test)
2. Read handover PDCA for full context
3. Check/abort any partial merge:
   ls .git/MERGE_* 2>/dev/null
   # If files exist, run:
   rm -f .git/MERGE_HEAD .git/index.lock
   git reset --hard HEAD
4. Create fresh branch:
   git checkout origin/release/dev
   git checkout -b recovery/post-hang-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
5. Document in new PDCA

EMERGENCY RECOVERY (if terminal hung):
- Use file tools only (no terminal)
- Read files directly
- Document state for next agent
- Request human intervention

REMEMBER: Goal is working state on release/dev, not fixing the merge.
```

### **Additional Context Needed**
1. Commit SHA of origin/release/dev HEAD
2. Last known good commit before merge attempt
3. Exact branch the next agent will start on
4. Whether updown-dev-container is running [[memory:5469213]]

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Simulation revealed need for clearer state verification steps, exact paths, and terminal health check in wake-up prompt.
