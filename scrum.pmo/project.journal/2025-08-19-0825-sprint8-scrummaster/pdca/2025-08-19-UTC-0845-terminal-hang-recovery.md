# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Terminal Hang Recovery - 2025-08-19-UTC-0845**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-19-UTC-0845  
**🎯 Objective:** Recover from terminal hang during git merge operation  
**👤 Role:** ScrumMaster  
**🚨 Issues:** Terminal went into "nirvana" state during git merge command

## **✅ Summary**

**📊 QA Decisions**
- [x] Identified terminal hang issue (known problem per diary.entry.md)
- [x] Terminal commands going "into nirvana" - not responding
- [x] Need alternative approach to complete merge
- [ ] Complete merge using file-based operations
- [ ] Restore recovery.analysis from backup

## **📋 Plan**

### **Objective**
Recover from terminal hang and complete the merge operation without using terminal commands

### **Context from diary.entry.md**
- Previous agent discovered terminal hanging issue with release/dev branch
- Agents were going "into nirvana" - endless hang
- This is a known critical bug affecting recovery processes

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Terminal Hang Identification**
1. Attempted: `git merge origin/release/dev --strategy-option=theirs`
2. Terminal became unresponsive
3. All subsequent terminal commands fail silently
4. User confirmed: "your terminal did stop. every command you are sending now is going into nirvana"

### **Recovery Actions**
1. Created backup of recovery.analysis before hang: `recovery.analysis.backup`
2. Read diary.entry.md to understand the issue
3. Documenting the issue in this PDCA

---

## **🔍 Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Quote**: "your terminal did stop. every command you are sending now is going into nirvana. another you (another agent) has already described this in /workspace/workspacesMountPoint/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-18-1023-recovery-analysis/diary.entry.md"  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-19-UTC-0845

### **Known Issue Pattern**
From diary.entry.md:
- "The `release/dev` branch, which the main README directed agents to use, was sending every agent 'into nirvana' - an endless hang"
- This appears to be the same issue manifesting during merge

---

## **⚡ Act**

### **Alternative Approaches Without Terminal**
1. Use file-based tools to check git status
2. Read .git files directly to understand merge state
3. Manual file operations to complete merge if possible
4. Request user assistance for terminal operations

### **Immediate Actions**
- Document this occurrence for future agents
- Work with available non-terminal tools
- Preserve recovery.analysis folder as requested

---

## **🎯 PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Terminal operations involving release/dev can trigger the "nirvana" hang bug.

**Process Enhancement**: Future merges with release/dev should be approached with caution, possibly requiring user intervention.

**Quality Impact**: This reinforces the V4 recovery design principle of "routing around problems" rather than fixing them.

## **📝 One-Line Summary**
Terminal hung during release/dev merge operation - known issue per diary.entry.md, requiring alternative approach to complete merge.
