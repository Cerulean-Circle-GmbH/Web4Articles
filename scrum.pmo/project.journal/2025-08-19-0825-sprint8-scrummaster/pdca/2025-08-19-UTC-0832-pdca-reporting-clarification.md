# üìã **PDCA Cycle: PDCA Reporting Clarification - 2025-08-19-UTC-0832**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-19-UTC-0832  
**üéØ Objective:** Correct critical misunderstanding about PDCA reporting  
**üë§ Role:** ScrumMaster  
**üö® Issues:** I taught the exact OPPOSITE of what user wants

## **‚úÖ Summary**

**üìä QA Decisions**
- [x] User wants dual links ONLY in chat
- [x] PDCA content goes in files
- [x] Chat should be minimal
- [ ] Must fix agent.recovery.md
- [ ] Must fix all documentation

## **üìã Plan**

### **Objective**
Understand and document the CORRECT way to report PDCAs

---

## **üî® Do**

### **What I Did Wrong**
- Told agents to report PDCA content inline
- Said "NEVER say 'I saved it at path X'"
- Completely backwards!

### **What User Actually Wants**
```
User quote from earlier: "as always short answer in the chat 
(just links and descisions to be made) and a comprehensive 
answer in the pdca and std links to the created artefacts 
in dual fromat"
```

---

## **üîç Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Quote**: "THATS WRONG i want it exactly the other way round. i want just the dual links not the content directly in the chat as you can see from my prvious request also."  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-19-UTC-0832

### **The Correct Pattern**
**In Chat**: 
- Brief status/decision points
- Dual format links: [GitHub](link) | [local](link)
- NO lengthy content

**In PDCA File**:
- Comprehensive analysis
- Full details
- User quotes
- Complete documentation

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Must Fix Documentation**

**Correct agent.recovery.md Addition**:
```markdown
## PDCA Reporting
When asked for PDCA:
1. Create comprehensive PDCA in file
2. Quote user feedback literally
3. Respond with dual links only:
   [GitHub](link) | [local-path](link)

Keep chat minimal - details go in PDCA file!
```

### **Fix Previous Damage**
- Update test agent's PDCA
- Correct any documentation that says "report inline"
- Ensure all agents learn the RIGHT way

---

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: User wants separation of concerns - minimal chat for quick scanning, comprehensive PDCAs in files for deep review.

**Process Enhancement**: Always verify understanding before teaching others.

**Quality Impact**: This affects ALL agent training - critical to fix immediately.

---

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Critical correction: PDCAs should be comprehensive in files with only dual links in chat, not inline reporting - I was teaching the exact opposite!
