## **üìã Plan**

### **Objective**
Make PDCA creation and proper reporting the minimum achievement for successful recovery

---

## **üî® Do**

### **Updated agent.recovery.v4.md**

**Added MANDATORY Section**:
- Big warning: "RECOVERY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A PDCA!"
- Step 1: Create PDCA file
- Step 2: Report with dual links ONLY
- Clear example of correct reporting format

**Updated Success Metrics**:
```markdown
1. ‚úÖ Created working session in under 10 minutes
2. ‚úÖ Created and saved PDCA file  
3. ‚úÖ Reported PDCA with dual links (not inline content)
```

**Key Emphasis**:
- "No PDCA = No Recovery!"
- "PDCA proves you can work AND communicate"
- "User needs links, not walls of text"

## **üîç Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Quote**: "please fix the mai importance of the pdca process as a minimum achievment after recovery. then we test another agent with your recovery optimizations."  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-19-UTC-0840

### **Previous Issues Fixed**
- ‚ùå Was: Agent saves PDCA, says "I saved it at X"
- ‚ùå Was: No guidance on reporting format
- ‚úÖ Now: Clear mandatory steps with examples
- ‚úÖ Now: Success requires proper PDCA reporting

---

## **‚ö° Act**

### **Ready for Next Test**
1. agent.recovery.v4.md now emphasizes PDCA as mandatory
2. Clear instructions on dual-link reporting
3. Success metrics include communication ability

### **Test Protocol**
- Give agent: "recover from readme"
- Verify: Creates PDCA within recovery
- Verify: Reports with dual links only
- Measure: Time to productive PDCA

---

## **üéØ PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Recovery without communication ability is incomplete recovery.

**Process Enhancement**: PDCA is now the minimum bar, not an optional nice-to-have.

**Quality Impact**: Next agent should complete recovery WITH proper PDCA reporting in under 10 minutes.

---

## **üìù One-Line Summary**
Updated recovery V4 to make PDCA creation and dual-link reporting mandatory - ready to test if agents now understand communication is part of recovery.
