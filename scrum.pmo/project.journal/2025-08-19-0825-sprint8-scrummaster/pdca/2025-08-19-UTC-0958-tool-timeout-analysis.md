# PDCA: Tool Timeout Analysis During Recovery Process

**Date**: 2025-08-19 UTC 09:58  
**Agent**: Background Recovery Agent  
**Context**: Experiencing multiple tool timeouts while trying to complete recovery documentation  
**Status**: üî¥ Active Issue

## 1. PLAN

### Objective
- Document tool timeout issues for future agents
- Identify patterns in timeout behavior
- Complete recovery process despite timeouts

### Scope
- Tool timeout occurrences
- Impact on recovery workflow
- Mitigation strategies

## 2. DO

### Timeout Occurrences Documented
1. **read_file timeout** (160s): `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0840-recovery-pdca-minimum-achievement.md`
2. **read_file interrupted**: Next file read attempt was interrupted
3. **grep timeout** (220s): Searching for "recovery.*from.*readme" pattern
4. **list_dir timeout** (140s): Attempting to list recovery.analysis directory
5. **git commit interrupted**: Attempting to commit PDCA changes

### Pattern Observed
- File operations timing out after 140-220 seconds
- Both read and search operations affected
- Even simple directory listings failing
- Git operations also interrupted

## 3. CHECK

### QA Feedback (quote literally)
> are you hanging? if so observe and document so you can learn!

### Analysis
1. **Not a terminal hang** - I can still create new files (this PDCA)
2. **Selective tool failure** - Write operations work, read/search operations timeout
3. **Possible causes**:
   - Large file sizes causing read timeouts
   - Complex directory structures
   - System resource constraints
   - Network/filesystem issues

### What Still Works
- ‚úÖ Write/create new files
- ‚úÖ Search/replace in files
- ‚úÖ Terminal commands (until interrupted)
- ‚ùå Read file operations
- ‚ùå Directory listings
- ‚ùå Grep searches

## 4. ACT

### Immediate Mitigation
1. **Prefer write operations** over reads when possible
2. **Use search_replace** for updates instead of read-then-write
3. **Document findings** immediately in new files
4. **Batch operations** to minimize tool calls

### Recommendations for Future Agents
1. **If experiencing timeouts**:
   - Document immediately (writes still work)
   - Try smaller file ranges instead of full reads
   - Use search_replace for targeted updates
   - Create new files rather than reading old ones

2. **Recovery Strategy During Timeouts**:
   - Focus on creating documentation
   - Update files using search_replace
   - Avoid grep on large codebases
   - Keep operations simple and targeted

3. **PDCA Creation During Timeouts**:
   - Write new PDCA directly
   - Use search_replace to update existing PDCAs
   - Don't rely on reading templates - know the format
   - Include this timeout pattern in handover notes

### Key Learning
**Tool timeouts don't mean complete system failure** - Write operations and targeted updates still work. Adapt strategy to use available tools rather than waiting for timeouts.

**Critical Note for Next Agent**: If you encounter similar timeouts, focus on write operations and search_replace. The system is partially functional, not completely hung.
