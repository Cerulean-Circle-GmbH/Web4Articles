# PDCA: Terminal Hang Recovery - Successful Resolution

**Date**: 2025-08-19 UTC 09:49  
**Agent**: Recovery Agent (Background)  
**Context**: Recovery from reported terminal hang during git merge operation  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Recovered

## 1. PLAN

### Initial Situation Assessment
- **Reported Issue**: Previous agent experienced terminal hang during git merge
- **Expected State**: Terminal non-responsive, possible partial merge state
- **Recovery Goal**: Create fresh branch from release/dev and document recovery

### Recovery Strategy
1. Test terminal responsiveness
2. Check current git state and branch
3. Look for partial merge artifacts
4. Create fresh branch from origin/release/dev
5. Document recovery process

## 2. DO

### Terminal State Check
```bash
$ echo "Terminal responsive - $(date)"
Terminal responsive - Tue Aug 19 09:48:19 AM UTC 2025
```
✅ Terminal was fully responsive - no hang detected

### Git State Analysis
```bash
$ git branch --show-current
cursor/recover-from-terminal-hang-and-merge-7dd4

$ git status
On branch cursor/recover-from-terminal-hang-and-merge-7dd4
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
✅ Clean working tree, no merge conflicts

### Merge State Check
```bash
$ ls -la .git/MERGE_*
ls: cannot access '.git/MERGE_*': No such file or directory
```
✅ No partial merge state found

### Fresh Branch Creation
```bash
$ git fetch origin release/dev
$ git checkout -b cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949 origin/release/dev
Switched to a new branch 'cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949'
```
✅ Successfully created fresh branch from release/dev

### Artifacts Changed
- No files were changed during recovery (clean branch switch only)
- Created this PDCA: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0949-terminal-hang-recovery-successful.md`

> VERIFY YOUR STATE:
> 1. Test terminal: echo "Terminal responsive - $(date)"
> 2. If no response in 5 seconds, terminal is hung - use file tools only
> 3. Check current branch: git branch --show-current
> 
> SITUATION:
> 1. Previous agent on branch: cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc
> 2. Attempted to merge origin/release/dev into this old branch  
> 3. Terminal hung due to massive branch divergence
> 4. Backup exists at: /workspace/recovery.analysis.backup
> 5. Possible partial merge state in .git/
> 
> YOUR MISSION:
> 1. Read handover PDCA above FIRST (full path provided)
> 2. Follow "SAFE RECOVERY STEPS" section exactly
> 3. Do NOT attempt to complete the merge
> 4. Create fresh branch from release/dev instead
> 5. Document your recovery in new PDCA
> 
> EMERGENCY FALLBACK:
> If terminal is completely unresponsive, read /workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md using file tools.
> 
> REMEMBER: The goal is to get to a working state on release/dev, not to fix the broken merge. Route around the problem. Ensure Documentation as PDCA to continue in your next iteration and learn from that in case the problem occurs again.

### Recovery Verification
1. **Terminal State**: Fully operational, no hang detected
2. **Git State**: Clean, on fresh branch from release/dev
3. **Working Tree**: Clean, no uncommitted changes
4. **Branch Tracking**: Properly tracking origin/release/dev

### Discrepancies from Handover
- Expected files not found:
  - `/workspace/EMERGENCY_HANDOVER.md` (SHA mentioned: ced43b43a65d285a3758ee4e2dc7238d68a81571)
  - Previous PDCA at specified path
  - `/workspace/recovery.analysis.backup` mentioned in handover
- Found on different branch than mentioned (`cursor/recover-scrum-session-from-readme-53bc`)

## 4. ACT

### Key Learnings
1. **Always verify handover information** - Files and states mentioned may not exist
2. **Terminal recovery may be automatic** - The terminal appeared to have recovered on its own
3. **Fresh branch approach works** - Creating new branch from release/dev is safer than attempting complex merges

### Future Recovery Protocol
1. **Test terminal first** - Simple echo command confirms responsiveness
2. **Check git state thoroughly** - branch, status, and merge artifacts
3. **When in doubt, fresh start** - New branch from stable base is safest
4. **Document discrepancies** - Note when handover information doesn't match reality

### Recommendations
1. **Standardize handover format** - Use structured format with verifiable information
2. **Include fallback procedures** - When primary recovery path fails
3. **Timestamp everything** - Helps track when issues occurred vs when recovered

## Summary

Successfully recovered from reported terminal hang situation. The terminal was found to be responsive, suggesting either automatic recovery or incorrect initial assessment. Created fresh branch from release/dev as instructed, ensuring clean working state for continued development.

**Next Steps**: Continue with development tasks on the fresh `cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949` branch.
