### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1: Focus Area Selection** - Selected: Tool Usage (1) - Focus on analyzing and optimizing tool usage patterns
- [x] **Decision 2: Session Role Selection** - Selected: Ontology Agent Role (2) - Analyze knowledge structures and semantic relationships
- [x] **Decision 3: Session Duration Expectation** - Selected: Open-ended Session (3d) - Continue until natural stopping point

3d
```

### **My Answer**
Initializing Background Agent session following the recovery procedure. Created dev/2025-09-07-UTC-1921 branch, installed git hooks, and prepared PDCA framework. User selected: Tool Usage focus (1), Ontology Agent Role (2), Open-ended session (3d). Proceeding with tool usage analysis and ontology review.

**Learning Applied:** Following the minimalist chat approach with detailed documentation in PDCA files, presenting real decisions with numbered format for mobile-friendly responses.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish optimal PDCA workflow and prepare for user-directed session work

**Requirements Traceability:** Following recovery/start-command.md protocol

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Branch Management:** Created dev/2025-09-07-UTC-1921 for session work
- **PDCA Framework:** Initialized with proper template format and dual links
- **Decision Framework:** Applied startup decision framework with 3 standard choices
- **Git Automation:** Installed post-commit hook for auto-merge functionality

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Verified PDCA documentation exists
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md

# Created dev branch for session work  
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
```

**2. Git Automation Installation**
```bash
# Created post-commit hook for auto-merge
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**3. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
# Created session directory structure
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-07-UTC-1921-session/pdca/role/background-agent
```

**4. PDCA Documentation**
- Read howto.PDCA.md template format and requirements
- Read PDCA.howto.decide.md for decision framework guidance
- Applied 6-section mandatory format with dual links
- Created session startup PDCA with proper header structure

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Branch Management (✅)**
- Started on cursor/start-background-process-ca16
- Successfully created dev/2025-09-07-UTC-1921
- Git hooks installed and executable
- Session directory structure created

**PDCA Framework (✅)**
- Template version 3.1.4.2 applied
- 6 mandatory sections included
- Dual links format implemented
- Startup decision framework applied

**Decision Quality (✅)**
- 3 real decisions with distinct outcomes
- Numbered format (1a, 2b) for mobile compatibility
- Clear rationale for each option
- Follows "real decisions only" philosophy

**Recovery Protocol Compliance (✅)**

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Await User Decision Response** - Expecting format "1a, 2b, 3c" for the three decisions
2. **Execute Based on Choices** - Implement user-selected focus area, role, and duration
3. **Begin Session Work** - Start actual development/improvement work
4. **Maintain PDCA Documentation** - Continue documenting all significant work

**Process Improvements:**
- PDCA framework successfully initialized
- Startup decision framework working as designed
- Git automation ready for seamless integration
- Session documentation structure established

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Monitor decision response format effectiveness
- Refine session startup efficiency
- Enhance background agent autonomous capabilities
