### **My Answer**
Session continued in existing directory. Environment loaded, main branch synchronized. Startup decisions prepared for user selection.

**Learning Applied:** Continue in same session directory; present standard decision framework.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Present startup decisions; establish session scope and role based on user selection.

**Requirements Traceability:** Following memory-guided project conventions

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Session Continuity:** Use existing session directory (2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session)
- **Decision Framework:** Present standard 3-category decision structure
- **Environment:** Web4Articles environment loaded, main branch synchronized
- **Version Control:** Commit and push for GitHub link traceability

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Continuation Steps**

1. ✅ Reset to main branch and pull latest
2. ✅ Source environment file (Web4Articles environment loaded)
3. ✅ Navigate to existing session directory
4. ✅ Create new PDCA with startup decisions
5. ⏳ Present decisions to user
6. ⏳ Create project state document
7. ⏳ Commit and push changes

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Environment Status**
- ✅ Main branch: synchronized and current
- ✅ Web4Articles environment: loaded with scripts in PATH
- ✅ Session directory: continuing in 2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session
- ✅ PDCA structure: using latest template format

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"start"**

**Validation Items**
- ✅ Session continuation in existing directory
- ✅ Standard startup decisions prepared
- ✅ Environment properly initialized

## **🎯 ACT**

**Next Actions:** Awaiting user decisions to establish:

1. **Primary Work Focus Area** (Technical/Architecture/Documentation/Quality)
2. **Role Selection** (Background Agent/Developer/Architect/Tester)  
3. **Session Duration** (Full day/Half day/Quick analysis/Extended)

**Benefits:**
- **Continuity:** Using existing session maintains context
- **Clarity:** Decision framework provides structured direction
- **Efficiency:** Environment ready for immediate work

**Ready for:** User decision selection to proceed with focused work.

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Ready and organized**

### **Determination:**
**SYSTEMATIC** Environment prepared and awaiting direction

### **Gratitude:**
**APPRECIATIVE** for clear project conventions and structure

### **Satisfaction:**
**CONFIDENT** in session setup and decision framework

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Session Continuity:** Maintain existing session directories
- ✅ **Environment Setup:** Always source environment and sync main
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Present structured choices for clarity

**Quality Impact:** Ensures organized workflow and user control
