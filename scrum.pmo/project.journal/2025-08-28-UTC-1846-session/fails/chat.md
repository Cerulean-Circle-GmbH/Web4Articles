Ready to go

Quick start option: say "scan" and I’ll inspect /workspace to auto-detect the project and propose next steps.
start (from main README.md)

Thought
for 9s
I'll open the main README to determine setup steps and start the project accordingly.
I'll check for the PDCA framework directory and get the current Git branch to document it before proceeding.
Thought
for 23s
I'll set up a small todo list for the session initialization tasks, then read the PDCA template and decision guide in parallel to draft the Session Start PDCA.
Verify PDCA framework presence; fetch/checkout only if missing
Read PDCA howto and decision framework to prepare PDCA
Create session journal dir and write project.status.md with branch metadata
Create Session Start PDCA file using template and decision framework
Commit and push PDCA and status files to origin
I'll read the PDCA template and decision guide now to draft the Session Start PDCA.
I finished reading the PDCA guide and decision framework. Now I’ll create the session journal and status file, then draft the Session Start PDCA with the 3 startup decisions and commit/push.
Verify PDCA framework presence; fetch/checkout only if missing
Read PDCA howto and decision framework to prepare PDCA
Create session journal dir and write project.status.md with branch metadata
Create Session Start PDCA file using template and decision framework
Commit and push PDCA and status files to origin
I'll create a timestamped PDCA file under the new session directory using the template and startup decision framework, then add, commit, and push it along with the status file.

for 16s
I created the session directory and attempted to generate and commit the PDCA, but the commit step failed due to a quoting issue. I'll locate the latest session directory, ensure the PDCA file exists (creating it if missing), then add, commit, and push with safe quoting.
I'll locate the latest session directory and create the PDCA file using a safe here-doc with variable expansion, then commit and push in a follow-up command.
Thought
for 31s
I'll fetch current branch, remote URL, last commit SHA/message, and the latest session dir to compose PDCA links, then create the PDCA file via an edit, and commit/push.

for 25s
Creating the PDCA file in the session directory, then committing and pushing it.

Added 2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session-start.md PDCA with startup decisions and dual links.
Committed and pushed to cursor/start-background-process-78bf.

Next step options for Quality/Testing focus (quick analysis):
Create minimal smoke test scaffold under test/ to validate setup
Or run targeted scripts you want validated
Say “smoke” to scaffold a basic test suite now, or specify areas to test.
