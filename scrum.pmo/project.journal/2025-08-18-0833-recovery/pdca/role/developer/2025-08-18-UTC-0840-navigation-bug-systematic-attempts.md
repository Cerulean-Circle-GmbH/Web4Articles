### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **CORE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: `[down]` navigation shows "Logger start" instead of "Logger"
- [x] **USER SPECIFICATION**: "[down] navigation shows only class, never methods"
- [x] **TEST FAILURE**: `expected 'Logger start' to match /Logger(?!\s+\w)/`
- [ ] **ROOT CAUSE RESOLVED**: Multiple systematic approaches failed to fix issue
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE REVIEW NEEDED**: Issue may be deeper than RangerView.ts logic

---

## **Plan**

Apply systematic debugging to the persistent navigation bug using multiple approaches to RangerView.ts logic, identifying why methods are displayed during navigation when user specification requires class-only display.

---

## **Do**

### **Core Issue (Still Persisting):**

**Test Failure**: `expected 'Logger start' to match /Logger(?!\s+\w)/`

- **Expected**: `Logger` (class only)
- **Actual**: `Logger start` (class + method "start")
- **User Specification**: *"[down] navigation shows only class, never methods"*

### **Systematic Fix Attempts This Morning:**

#### **Attempt 1: Added promptEditActive Check to tokenIdx===1**
```typescript
} else if (tokenIdx === 1 && model.promptEditActive) {
  // Method token: only show when explicitly advanced via [tab] or [right] AND in edit mode
  // Navigation mode (promptEditActive=false) should NEVER show methods
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Still failing - still shows "Logger start"

#### **Attempt 2: Enhanced Class+Method Condition**
```typescript
} else if (selectedClass && model.selectedMethod && model.promptEditActive && tokenIdx > 0) {
  // Advancement mode: show class + method ONLY when:
  // 1. prompt is active from [tab]/[right] AND 
  // 2. we're actually positioned on method token (tokenIdx > 0)
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Still failing - still shows "Logger start"

#### **Attempt 3: Prioritized Navigation Mode Logic**
```typescript
} else if (!model.promptEditActive && selectedClass) {
  // Navigation mode: ALWAYS show only class, NEVER methods (USER SPECIFICATION)
  // "[down] navigation shows only class, never methods" - this takes precedence
  display = selectedClass;
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Still failing - still shows "Logger start"

#### **Attempt 4: Simplified tokenIdx===0 Logic (Most Direct)**
```typescript
if (tokenIdx === 0) {
  // ...filter logic...
  } else if (selectedClass) {
    // TOKEN 0 (Class position): ALWAYS show only class, NEVER methods
    // User specification: "[down] navigation shows only class, never methods"
    // This is the simplest and most direct fix
    display = selectedClass;
  }
}
```

**Result**: ‚ùå Still failing - still shows "Logger start"

### **Deep Debug Analysis:**

#### **Test Helper Function Analysis:**
Found `getPromptLine()` function extracts prompt line from terminal output:
```typescript
function getPromptLine(out: string): string {
  const lines = out.split(/\r?\n/);
  const footerIdx = lines.findIndex(l => l.includes('column') && l.includes('Enter: select'));
  if (footerIdx > 1) {
    return lines[footerIdx - 2] || '';  // 2 lines above footer
  }
  return '';
}
```

#### **State Analysis Findings:**
- **`promptEditActive`**: Starts as `true` by default in RangerModel
- **`selectedColumn`**: Starts as `0` (Classes column)
- **Controller Logic**: Should set `promptEditActive = false` during navigation
- **RangerView Logic**: Multiple attempts to prevent method display failed

### **Architectural Suspicions:**

#### **Potential Root Causes:**
1. **Controller State Management**: Navigation might not be setting `promptEditActive = false` correctly
2. **Different Code Path**: Method display might be happening through a different path than `buildColoredCommand()`
3. **tokenIdx State**: `tokenIdx` might not be 0 during navigation as expected
4. **Rendering Pipeline**: Issue might be in how the prompt is assembled/rendered
5. **Test Environment**: Difference between manual testing and automated test environment

### **Evidence of Deeper Issue:**
- **4 systematic approaches** to RangerView.ts logic failed
- **Manual terminal output** sometimes shows correct "Logger" without method
- **Test continues to fail** with same error message
- **Multiple conditions added** but none prevent method display

## **Check**

### **Fix Effectiveness Assessment:**

**All Systematic Approaches Failed**: ‚ùå
- Added `promptEditActive` checks: ‚ùå
- Enhanced advancement conditions: ‚ùå
- Prioritized navigation logic: ‚ùå
- Simplified tokenIdx logic: ‚ùå

**Test Status**: ‚ùå Still failing with identical error message
**Manual Testing**: Shows mixed results - sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect
**Architecture Understanding**: Incomplete - issue deeper than initially thought

### **Learning and Insights:**

#### **What We Confirmed:**
- ‚úÖ **User specification is correct**: Navigation should show class only
- ‚úÖ **Test logic is correct**: Properly extracts prompt line with `getPromptLine()`
- ‚úÖ **Issue location identified**: Prompt display logic in navigation mode
- ‚úÖ **Systematic approach works**: Multiple targeted attempts provide good debugging data

#### **What We Discovered:**
- ‚ùå **RangerView.ts fixes insufficient**: Issue persists despite logic changes
- ‚ùå **State management complex**: Multiple conditions interact in unexpected ways
- ‚ùå **Architecture gaps**: Missing understanding of full rendering pipeline
- ‚ùå **Root cause elusive**: Problem may be in controller, model, or view integration

### **Process Validation:**

**Systematic Debugging**: ‚úÖ Applied multiple targeted approaches
**No Panic Decisions**: ‚úÖ No destructive git operations, careful testing
**Documentation**: ‚úÖ Each attempt documented with specific code changes
**User Specification Adherence**: ‚úÖ Clear understanding of "[down] shows class only"

---

## **Act**

### **Next Phase Strategy:**

#### **Option A: Deeper Architecture Investigation (Recommended)**
1. **Controller State Tracing**: Verify `promptEditActive` state during navigation
2. **Full Rendering Pipeline Analysis**: Trace from key press to display output
3. **Alternative Display Paths**: Check if methods shown through different code path
4. **tokenIdx Verification**: Confirm tokenIdx value during navigation

#### **Option B: User Collaboration**
- Present current systematic attempts to user
- Request guidance on architectural approach
- Get user assessment of fix importance vs. other priorities

#### **Option C: Targeted Investigation**
1. **Add debug logging** to understand exact state during navigation
2. **Compare working vs failing cases** in manual testing
3. **Minimal reproduction** to isolate the exact failure condition

### **Recovery Dawn Assessment:**

**Progress Made**: ‚úÖ Systematic approach, no destructive actions, clear documentation
**Issue Complexity**: Higher than initially estimated - architectural rather than logic fix
**User Trust**: Maintained through systematic, non-destructive debugging
**Learning**: Significant insights into RangerView.ts structure and test methodology

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Document comprehensive analysis** for user review
2. **Commit current systematic attempts** to preserve debugging work  
3. **Await user guidance** on next phase approach
4. **No further changes** without deeper architectural understanding
