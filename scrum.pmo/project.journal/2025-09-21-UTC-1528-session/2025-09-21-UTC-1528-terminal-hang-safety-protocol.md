### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Terminal hang confirmed: All commands timeout after 900 seconds
- [x] Safety protocol activated: Cannot execute terminal commands safely
- [ ] **Decision 1: System Recovery Approach**
  - a) Wait for system administrator intervention
  - b) Document issue and continue with file operations only
  - c) Request system restart/reset

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-1530)**
```quote
use the savety protcol and pdca. show on wich branch you are
```

### **My Answer**
I cannot determine the current branch due to complete terminal unresponsiveness. All terminal commands are timing out after 900 seconds, which matches the exact scenario described in the Web4Articles safety guidelines about background agents encountering terminal hangs. I'm implementing the safety protocol by:

1. Documenting the issue in this PDCA
2. Avoiding further terminal commands that could worsen the situation
3. Using only file operations that don't require terminal interaction

**Learning Applied:** Background agents must recognize terminal hang situations and switch to file-only operations to prevent system damage.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
Implement Web4Articles safety protocol for terminal hang situations:
1. Document the terminal hang with timestamps and symptoms
2. Avoid any further terminal commands that could cause system damage
3. Use file operations only for continued work
4. Present clear decision options for system recovery

### **Expected Outcomes**
- Terminal hang situation properly documented
- Safety protocol prevents further system degradation
- Clear path forward for system recovery
- User can make informed decision about next steps

### **Risk Assessment**
- **HIGH RISK:** Further terminal commands could worsen system state
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Work continuity impacted until recovery
- **LOW RISK:** File operations remain safe and functional

## **🔧 DO**

### **Terminal Hang Evidence**
**Symptoms Observed:**
- Command: `timeout 10 bash -c "ps aux | head -5"` → Timeout after 900s
- Command: `ps aux | grep -c Z` → Timeout after 900s  
- Command: `echo "System check"` → Timeout after 900s
- **Pattern:** All terminal commands completely unresponsive

**Timeline:**
- 2025-09-21-UTC-1528: Session started successfully
- 2025-09-21-UTC-1529: User requested merge operation
- 2025-09-21-UTC-1530: User requested safety protocol due to hanging
- 2025-09-21-UTC-1530: Terminal hang confirmed

### **Safety Protocol Implementation**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Stopped attempting terminal commands
   - Switched to file-only operations
   - Created this PDCA for documentation

2. **Current Branch Status:**
   - **ASSUMED:** dev/2025-09-21-UTC-1528 (last known state)
   - **CANNOT VERIFY:** Terminal unresponsive to `git branch --show-current`
   - **RISK:** Unknown if branch state is stable

3. **System State Assessment:**
   - Terminal: UNRESPONSIVE (900s timeouts)
   - File Operations: FUNCTIONAL
   - Git Status: UNKNOWN (cannot check)

## **✅ CHECK**

### **Validation Results**
- ✅ Terminal hang confirmed with multiple command timeouts
- ✅ Safety protocol activated (no further terminal commands)
- ✅ PDCA documentation created successfully
- ❌ Cannot verify current branch (terminal unresponsive)
- ❌ Cannot check system processes or zombie count
- ❌ Cannot execute git commands safely

### **Safety Compliance**
- ✅ Following Web4Articles safety guidelines
- ✅ Avoiding commands that cause terminal hangs
- ✅ Using atomic operations only (file writes)
- ✅ Documenting issue for system administrator

### **Risk Mitigation**
- ✅ Prevented further system degradation
- ✅ Maintained work documentation
- ✅ Provided clear decision framework

---

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **User Decision Required:** System recovery approach selection
2. **If Option A:** Wait for system administrator to resolve terminal hang
3. **If Option B:** Continue with file-only operations, document all work
4. **If Option C:** Request system restart to clear hanging processes

### **Safety Protocol Maintenance**
- **NO TERMINAL COMMANDS** until hang resolved
- **FILE OPERATIONS ONLY** for continued work
- **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** for recovery tracking
- **PRESENT CLEAR DECISIONS** for user guidance

### **System Recovery Preparation**
Once terminal responsiveness restored:
```bash
# Commands to run AFTER recovery:
git branch --show-current  # Verify branch
git status                 # Check working directory
ps aux | grep -c Z        # Check zombie processes  
git log --oneline -1      # Verify last commit
```

### **Continuous Monitoring**
- Monitor for terminal responsiveness return
- Document any partial recovery attempts
- Maintain PDCA chain for full recovery tracking
- Prepare for system administrator handoff if needed

**CRITICAL:** Terminal completely unresponsive. Safety protocol active. User decision required for recovery approach.
