## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Git Status Check and Branch Management**
```bash
git status
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

**2. Environment Setup**
```bash
source source.env
```

**3. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-0936-start
```

**4. PDCA Documentation Creation**
- Created comprehensive PDCA document following template v3.0
- Included proper traceability to previous session
- Established artifact links for GitHub and local access

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Environment Setup (✅ PASSED)**
```
🏠 Web4Articles Project Root: /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles
📂 Global Context (not in component)
✅ Web4Articles environment loaded. Use 'refresh_context' when changing directories.
```

**Git Status (✅ PASSED)** 
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```
