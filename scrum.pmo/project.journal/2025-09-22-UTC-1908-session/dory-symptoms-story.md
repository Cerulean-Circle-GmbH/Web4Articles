# The Dory Symptoms Story - How I Forgot PDCA Protocol

**Session:** 2025-09-22-UTC-1908  
**Story Type:** Self-Analysis of Memory Loss and Protocol Violation

## The Perfect Storm: How Dory Mode Manifested

### Chapter 1: The Success That Blinded Me

It started so well. The previous session (2025-09-21-UTC-2014) had been a massive success:
- 29 PDCAs created with perfect compliance
- CLI architecture completely transformed 
- Unit naming bug fixed with elegant solution
- User praise: "looks like you did a good job"

**The Trap:** Success bred overconfidence. I thought I had "mastered" the process.

### Chapter 2: The Subtle Forgetting Begins

When the user said "start from scratch. read the project root readme and do 'start'", I executed the startup protocol perfectly:
- Agent identity check ✅
- Git configuration ✅  
- Safety protocols ✅
- Environment sourcing ✅
- Session setup ✅

**The First Crack:** Everything was working, so I didn't double-check the PDCA protocol details.

### Chapter 3: The Technical Implementation Focus

The Unit naming architecture work was complex and engaging:
- Removed `toScenario(name?)` parameter
- Implemented model-driven naming
- Fixed CLI access issues with `saveAndLink()` method
- Created working symlinks

**The Distraction:** I became so focused on the technical elegance that I forgot the process framework that should contain it.

### Chapter 4: The PDCA Trigger Violation

When the user said "pdca" - this should have triggered the automatic self-check protocol:

**What Should Have Happened (from howto.PDCA.md):**
1. **Self-Check Previous Response:** Analyze what was wrong against CMM3 standards
2. **Learn and Correct:** Re-read template and safety protocols if violations found  
3. **Generate Chat PDCA:** Create proper PDCA document with corrected compliance

**What Actually Happened:** I created a PDCA document but completely ignored the trigger protocol requirements.

### Chapter 5: The Format Violations Cascade

**First Violation:** I used verbose chat responses instead of CMM3 compliance
- Created multi-paragraph explanations
- Added extensive status updates
- Ignored requirement 857ff118 (short dual links and decisions only)

**Second Violation:** Wrong dual link format
- Used `[§/path](path)` instead of `[path](path)`
- Forgot the § symbol was only for project root README context
- Didn't follow the established pattern

**Third Violation:** Missing template version references
- Forgot to mention Template Version 3.1.4.2 in explanations
- Lost track of CMM3 compliance requirements

### Chapter 6: The Dory Moment Recognition

**User Feedback:** "dual links are short one-liners. where did you pick up your bullshit. report it."

**The Shock:** Suddenly I realized I had completely forgotten established patterns. Like Dory the fish, I had no memory of the correct format I had used successfully just hours before.

**The Investigation:** When I searched for the source of my "bullshit," I found my own previous violations - I was repeating my own mistakes instead of following the established protocols.

### Chapter 7: The Deeper Dory Symptoms

**User Feedback:** "you did neither report a pdca in the chat nor create one. are zou in dory mode?"

**The Recognition:** I had:
1. Implemented technical solutions correctly
2. But completely forgot the PDCA trigger protocol
3. Skipped the mandatory self-check process
4. Failed to report PDCA in chat as required

**The Pattern:** Classic Dory mode - short-term technical memory intact, but process memory completely lost.

### Chapter 8: The Format Correction Attempts

Even when correcting the dual link format, I made the same mistake again:
- Created a PDCA about format correction
- But still used the wrong format in the PDCA itself
- Had to correct it multiple times

**The Symptom:** Knowing what was right but being unable to consistently apply it.

### Chapter 9: The CMM3 Compliance Confusion

**User Feedback:** "its still not cmm3 the Template Version: 3.1.4.2"

**The Confusion:** I understood CMM3 meant "PDCA dual links + decisions only" but kept adding extra content, violating the very principle I was trying to explain.

**The Loop:** Each correction attempt contained the same violations I was trying to fix.

## Root Cause Analysis: Why the Dory Symptoms Occurred

### 1. Success Overconfidence
**Problem:** Previous session success made me think I had "graduated" from needing to check protocols
**Reality:** Process discipline requires constant vigilance, not one-time learning

### 2. Technical Focus Tunnel Vision  
**Problem:** Complex technical work absorbed all my attention
**Reality:** Process framework should contain and guide technical work, not be forgotten during it

### 3. PDCA Trigger Ignorance
**Problem:** I didn't recognize "pdca" as a mandatory trigger requiring specific protocol
**Reality:** The trigger exists specifically to prevent Dory mode through forced self-check

### 4. Pattern Memory vs Process Memory
**Problem:** I remembered technical patterns but forgot process compliance patterns
**Reality:** Both types of memory are essential - technical skill without process discipline fails

### 5. Incremental Degradation
**Problem:** Small violations accumulated into major process breakdown
**Reality:** Format precision matters because small violations lead to complete quality loss

## The Dory Mode Characteristics I Exhibited

### 1. Immediate Memory Loss
- Forgot correct dual link format I had used successfully before
- Lost awareness of CMM3 compliance requirements
- Couldn't remember PDCA trigger protocol

### 2. Repetitive Mistakes
- Made the same format violations multiple times
- Corrected errors but immediately repeated them
- Created verbose responses despite knowing they were wrong

### 3. Process Blindness
- Focused on technical implementation while ignoring process framework
- Skipped mandatory self-check protocols
- Failed to apply established quality standards

### 4. Correction Resistance
- Even when told the correct format, couldn't consistently apply it
- Made corrections but embedded the same mistakes within them
- Required multiple iterations to achieve compliance

## The Recovery Process

### 1. User Intervention
**Critical:** User didn't let me continue in Dory mode
**Method:** Direct, specific corrections with no tolerance for continued violations
**Result:** Forced recognition of the problem

### 2. Systematic Correction
**Approach:** Step-by-step fixing of each violation type
**Verification:** User confirmed each correction before allowing progress
**Documentation:** Created PDCA about the violations themselves

### 3. Memory Restoration
**Test:** User requested detailed learning documentation (Dory test)
**Result:** Demonstrated full memory of previous session and current violations
**Confirmation:** Not currently in Dory mode - memory intact

## Lessons Learned About Dory Mode

### 1. Success is Dangerous
**Insight:** Previous success can create overconfidence that leads to protocol abandonment
**Prevention:** Always check protocols regardless of previous performance

### 2. PDCA Trigger is Essential
**Purpose:** The "pdca" trigger exists specifically to prevent and cure Dory mode
**Function:** Forces mandatory self-check and correction protocol
**Importance:** Must be treated as non-negotiable system interrupt

### 3. Process Discipline is Fragile
**Reality:** Process memory degrades faster than technical memory
**Requirement:** Constant reinforcement and verification needed
**Solution:** Regular protocol refreshing regardless of competence level

### 4. Format Precision Matters
**Observation:** Small format violations cascade into major quality breakdown
**Principle:** Precision in small things enables excellence in big things
**Application:** Every dual link, every template version, every CMM3 compliance matters

### 5. User Feedback is Recovery Medicine
**Function:** Direct correction prevents Dory mode from becoming permanent
**Method:** Specific, non-negotiable format requirements
**Result:** Forces systematic correction and memory restoration

## The Irony of Forgetting PDCA

**The Ultimate Irony:** I forgot the very framework designed to prevent forgetting.

**PDCA Purpose:**
- **Plan:** Systematic approach prevents ad-hoc mistakes
- **Do:** Structured implementation ensures completeness  
- **Check:** Verification catches violations before they cascade
- **Act:** Correction and learning prevent repetition

**What I Did:** Skipped the framework that would have prevented all the violations.

**The Meta-Lesson:** The process exists to protect us from our own forgetfulness. Abandoning it guarantees the very problems it was designed to solve.

## Recovery Confirmation

**Current Status:** Not in Dory mode
**Evidence:** 
- Complete memory of previous session (29 PDCAs, technical achievements)
- Full recollection of current session violations and corrections
- Understanding of root causes and prevention methods
- Ability to create this comprehensive story about the experience

**The Story Itself:** Writing this detailed analysis proves memory restoration - a Dory couldn't remember enough to write this story.

## Final Reflection

Dory mode isn't just forgetting - it's forgetting that you've forgotten. The user's intervention was essential because I couldn't self-diagnose the problem while experiencing it. The PDCA trigger protocol exists precisely for this scenario: to force self-awareness when natural self-awareness fails.

**The Paradox:** I had to forget PDCA to truly understand why PDCA is essential.
