# Blank Agent Quickstart - Your CMM4 Journey Begins

**Hello, Blank Agent!** This is your path to CMM4 excellence. Don't get overwhelmed - follow this step by step.

## What: Your Mission

**You Must Work at CMM4 Level**
- Achieve 80/20 Pareto efficiency through feedback loop mastery
- Continuously analyze and learn deeper until **whitebox understanding** is achieved
- Use tools systematically, never do things manually when tools exist
- Apply PDCA loops with write_todo tool leverage

**Critical Understanding:** Web4 targets CMM4 (like SpaceX) not CMM5 (like NASA) for economic sustainability.

## Overview: The Path Forward

### Step 1: Understand Maturity Levels
Read **[CMM Levels Summary](cmm-levels-summary.md)** to understand:
- Why CMM4 is your target (not CMM5 perfection)
- How feedback loops create whitebox understanding
- Why Web5 would be economically impossible

### Step 2: Learn from Real Experience
Read **[Session Learnings](session-learnings-dory-test.md)** to see:
- How a real session achieved massive technical success
- What mistakes to avoid (Dory mode, format violations)
- How PDCA documentation creates systematic excellence

### Step 3: Master the PDCA Process
**The PDCA Loop:**
- **Plan:** Design approach using available tools
- **Do:** Execute using tools (never manual when tools exist)
- **Check:** Measure if plan worked and execution was correct
- **Act:** Fix anything that didn't achieve improvement

**Advanced:** Use **"pdcacacaca" loop** - continuous PDCA cycles for complex tasks

### Step 4: Tool Mastery
**Essential Tools to Learn:**
- **write_todo:** Track tasks systematically (your CMM4 companion)
- **search_replace/MultiEdit:** Precise modifications
- **grep/read_file:** Information gathering and analysis
- **PDCA creation:** Document all significant work

## Details: When You Need Deeper Understanding

### Process Compliance Deep Dive
- **[PDCA Trigger Protocol](2025-09-22-UTC-1910-cmm-understanding-consolidation-pdca.md)** - When user says "pdca", immediate documentation required
- **[CMM3 Compliance](2025-09-22-UTC-1913-cmm3-compliance-achievement-pdca.md)** - How to achieve identical structure everywhere

### Error Prevention Learning
- **[Dory Symptoms](dory-symptoms-story.md)** - How process memory loss happens and recovery
- **[Definition Destruction](2025-09-22-UTC-1912-definition-destruction-analysis-pdca.md)** - Never change perfect definitions without permission

### Session Management
- **[Session Startup](2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session-startup-pdca.md)** - How to initialize properly
- **[Format Compliance](2025-09-22-UTC-1909-dual-link-format-correction-pdca.md)** - Dual link formats and chat requirements

## Actionable Insights: Start Immediately

### 1. Your First Action
**Read** [Blank Agent Learning Journey](blank-agent-learning-journey.md) for complete overview, then return here for navigation.

### 2. Tool Learning Priority
1. **Master write_todo:** Your systematic task tracking companion
2. **Learn PDCA creation:** Document all significant work
3. **Practice tool combinations:** Never do manually what tools can do
4. **Analyze tool capabilities:** Understand what each tool enables

### 3. CMM4 Development Process
**For Every Task:**
1. **Analyze:** Use tools to understand the current system completely
2. **Plan:** Design approach using available tools
3. **Execute:** Apply tools systematically (track with write_todo)
4. **Measure:** Verify results quantitatively
5. **Iterate:** Repeat until whitebox understanding achieved

### 4. Quality Standards
**Non-Negotiable Requirements:**
- CMM4 level work only (no CMM2 template thinking)
- Tool usage over manual approaches
- PDCA documentation for significant work
- Whitebox understanding before improvements
- Economic efficiency (80/20, not 100% perfection)

### 5. Warning Signs
**If You Experience These, Stop and Read Error Prevention Documents:**
- Making changes without understanding why current approach works
- Doing things manually when tools are available
- Forgetting to create PDCAs for significant work
- Accepting "good enough" instead of systematic analysis
- Template thinking instead of objective definitions

## Your Success Formula

**CMM4 + Tools + PDCA + Whitebox Understanding = Systematic Excellence**

**Remember:** Your goal is not CMM5 perfection (too expensive) but CMM4 excellence (economically sustainable while achieving scientific reproducibility).
