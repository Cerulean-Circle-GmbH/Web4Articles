### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Branch creation and learning preservation completed successfully

### **PDCA Trigger Self-Check Applied**
**Previous Response Violations:**
- ✅ Integrated CMM learning into README startup procedure
- ✅ Applied proper dual link format throughout documents
- ✅ Used CMM3 compliance for structural consistency
- ❌ **VIOLATION:** Did not create PDCA document for significant branch management work
- ❌ **VIOLATION:** Did not apply PDCA trigger protocol when user said "pdca"

**Correction:** Create proper PDCA documenting save/cmm-start branch creation and learning preservation

## **Plan**

### **Objective:**
Apply PDCA trigger protocol correctly and document the save/cmm-start branch creation for preserving the CMM learning journey.

### **Strategy:**
1. **PDCA Trigger Compliance:** Execute mandatory self-check and correction protocol
2. **Branch Management:** Document save/cmm-start creation and purpose
3. **Learning Preservation:** Ensure CMM understanding journey is properly saved
4. **Integration Documentation:** Record README integration of CMM4 framework
5. **Transition Preparation:** Prepare for blank agent testing with preserved materials

### **Requirements Traceability:**
- PDCA trigger: User said "pdca" requiring immediate protocol execution
- Branch creation: "create a new branch save/cmm-start and continue from there"
- Learning preservation: Comprehensive CMM understanding journey created
- Integration achievement: README startup procedure enhanced with CMM4 framework

## **Do**

### **1. PDCA Trigger Protocol Execution:**

#### **Self-Check Previous Response:**
**Analysis against CMM3 standards:**
- ✅ Applied user guidance for branch creation correctly
- ✅ Maintained proper dual link format in README integration
- ✅ Preserved CMM learning materials through branch transition
- ❌ **VIOLATION:** Created significant work (branch + README integration) without PDCA documentation
- ❌ **VIOLATION:** Ignored PDCA trigger requirement for systematic analysis

#### **Learning and Correction:**
**Re-read template and apply corrections:**
- PDCA trigger requires immediate PDCA creation for all significant work
- Branch management and README integration constitute major session work
- Documentation must capture the learning preservation intent and process

### **2. Save Branch Creation Documentation:**

#### **Branch Purpose:**
- **Name:** save/cmm-start
- **Purpose:** Preserve complete CMM learning journey for future blank agent testing
- **Content:** howto.cmm.md, CMM levels summary, session learnings, optimization PDCAs
- **Integration:** Enhanced README startup procedure with CMM4 framework first

#### **Learning Materials Preserved:**
- **howto.cmm.md:** Complete CMM4 understanding guide for blank agents
- **cmm-levels-summary.md:** Detailed maturity level explanations with examples
- **session-learnings-dory-test.md:** Real experience documentation
- **dory-symptoms-story.md:** Process memory loss prevention
- **Multiple PDCAs:** Systematic documentation of learning process

### **3. README Integration Achievement:**

#### **Enhancement Applied:**
- **Step 1 Added:** CMM4 framework understanding before all other processes
- **Purpose Clarification:** Agents understand PDCA as CMM4 feedback loop, not templates
- **Web4 Preparation:** Integrated tech stack and component documentation
- **Logical Flow:** CMM understanding → Safety protocols → PDCA application

#### **Expected Result:**
Blank agents will understand the systematic framework before applying processes, leading to CMM4-level work from the beginning instead of CMM2 template following.
