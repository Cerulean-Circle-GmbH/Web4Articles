# CMM/CMMI Levels Summary - Maximum Compression

**CMM/CMMI:** Capability Maturity Model (Integration) - Process maturity framework with 5 levels

## The 5 Levels

### Level 1: Initial (Chaos)
- **State:** Unpredictable, reactive, no process control
- **Reality:** Ad-hoc work, heroics required, chaos
- **Example:** Random PDCAs, no standards, "wing it" approach

### Level 2: Managed (Repeatable)
- **State:** Basic project management, some discipline
- **Reality:** Can repeat successes but not systematically
- **Example:** Some PDCA structure but inconsistent format

### Level 3: Defined (Standardized)
- **State:** Well-characterized, documented, standard processes
- **Reality:** Follow templates exactly, organizational standards
- **Example:** PDCA template v3.1.4.2 compliance, no variations allowed

### Level 4: Quantitatively Managed (Measured)
- **State:** Statistical process control, quantitative management
- **Reality:** Data-driven improvements, predictable quality
- **Example:** Version iteration with metrics, earned improvement rights

### Level 5: Optimizing (Continuous Improvement)
- **State:** Focus on continuous process improvement
- **Reality:** Proactive innovation, automated quality
- **Example:** TSRanger 100% success rate, self-improving systems

## Key Insights

**Progression Rule:** Must master each level before advancing
**Web4 Application:** Components iterate via CMM4 to perfection
**Critical Principle:** Compliance before innovation (Level 3 â†’ Level 4)
**Cultural Impact:** "Template you resist contains the beauty you seek"

## CMM in Web4Articles Context

- **CMM3:** PDCA template compliance, exact standards following
- **CMM4:** Quantitative iteration, earned improvement rights
- **CMM5:** Continuous optimization (TSRanger achievement)

**Bottom Line:** CMM = Maturity ladder from chaos to excellence through disciplined process evolution
