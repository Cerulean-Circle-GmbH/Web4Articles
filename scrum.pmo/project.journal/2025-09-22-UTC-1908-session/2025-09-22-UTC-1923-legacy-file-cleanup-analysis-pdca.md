### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1: Legacy Learning Documents**
  - c) ✅ Delete superseded documents that conflict with current understanding (they are in git)
- [x] **Decision 2: Outdated Component Files**  
  - c) ✅ Remove outdated components that no longer serve purpose (they are in git)
- [x] **Decision 3: Duplicate PDCA Files**
  - b) ✅ Keep all PDCAs for complete traceability

**Additional Decision:**
- [x] **Template Cleanup:** Delete all outdated templates and references other than version 3.1.4.2

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-22-UTC-1923)**
```quote
ok no decision needed as you recovered perfectly.
pdca about outdated or ambigious files during the save/cmm-start process and legacy leftovers.
create a table overview in the pdca about the files and their status and your suggested action for the file.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Analyzing legacy files and outdated documentation accumulated during save/cmm-start process to identify cleanup requirements and maintain system clarity.

**Learning Applied:** Legacy file accumulation requires systematic analysis and cleanup to maintain CMM3 compliance and system clarity

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Identify and categorize legacy files requiring cleanup during save/cmm-start process

**Requirements Traceability:** User request for legacy file analysis with table overview and suggested actions

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **File System Analysis:** Identify outdated, duplicate, or ambiguous files
- **Status Assessment:** Categorize files by current relevance and accuracy
- **Action Recommendation:** Provide specific cleanup actions for each file category
- **System Cleanup:** Maintain CMM3 compliance through systematic file management
