### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - CMM4 optimization through PDCA caca cycles for size vs understandability balance

### **User Feedback Integration**
- ✅ **User Love:** "i love that version" - foundation quality confirmed
- ✅ **Optimization Request:** Dual links in upper section, condense detail links upward
- ✅ **KPI Compromise:** Balance CMM4 size optimization vs understandability
- ✅ **Blank Agent Perspective:** Think through as blank agent, improve framing

## **Plan**

### **Objective:**
Apply CMM4 optimization to howto.cmm.md through PDCA caca cycles, balancing size reduction with understandability for blank agent consumption.

### **Strategy:**
1. **PDCA Caca Cycles:** Continuous Plan-Do-Check-Act iterations until optimization achieved
2. **Dual Link Integration:** Move detailed learning resources to upper section with dual links
3. **Size Optimization:** Reduce reading burden while maintaining understanding
4. **Blank Agent Perspective:** Think through document as target user
5. **Framing Improvement:** Enhance presentation and flow for optimal comprehension

### **Requirements Traceability:**
- User feedback: "add the dual links also in the upper into already"
- Optimization target: "the less the blank agent has to read the better"
- Quality balance: "hard KPI compromis between what to optimiye cmm4, siye or understandability"
- Process requirement: "pdca caca" - continuous improvement cycles

## **Do**

### **1. CMM4 Optimization Analysis:**

#### **Current State Assessment:**
- **Length:** Document is comprehensive but potentially overwhelming for blank agent
- **Structure:** Good intro, but detailed resources buried at bottom
- **Link Integration:** Missing dual links in early sections
- **User Experience:** Requires full read before accessing detailed resources

#### **Optimization Opportunities:**
- **Early Access:** Move dual links to upper section for immediate access
- **Resource Elevation:** Bring detailed materials forward for easier discovery
- **Condensation:** Reduce reading burden while maintaining comprehension
- **Flow Enhancement:** Improve framing for blank agent perspective

### **2. PDCA Caca Implementation:**

#### **Plan:** Optimize document structure with early dual link access
#### **Do:** Implement structural improvements
#### **Check:** Verify blank agent perspective and comprehension
#### **Act:** Refine until optimal balance achieved

### **3. Structural Optimization:**

#### **A. Early Dual Link Integration:**
- Move CMM Levels Summary link to immediately after mission statement
- Integrate learning resources in upper section with dual links
- Provide immediate access to detailed materials

#### **B. Blank Agent Perspective Enhancement:**
- Think through as someone completely new to the system
- Ensure clear progression from understanding to action
- Balance information density with comprehension

#### **C. Size vs Understanding Compromise:**
- Maintain essential CMM understanding (non-negotiable)
- Provide early access to detailed resources (efficiency)
- Optimize reading flow for maximum comprehension per word

## **Check**

### **✅ Optimization Verification:**

#### **Blank Agent Experience:**
- ✅ **Early Access:** Dual links available in upper section
