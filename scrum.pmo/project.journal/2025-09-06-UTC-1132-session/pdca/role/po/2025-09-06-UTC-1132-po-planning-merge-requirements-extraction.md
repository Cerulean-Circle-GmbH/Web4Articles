### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Requirements Extraction:** Moved requirements mapping to separate requiremnents file
- [x] **Planning Merge:** Integrated tasks from planning-2025-09-06-UTC-0730.md 
- [x] **Priority Organization:** Organized all tasks in sensible priority order
- [x] **Document Structure:** Optimized planning document structure for clarity

### **User Feedback Received**
User request: "ok better. put the requiremen mapping into an own file. merge the other timestamped planning into your planning in a priority order that makes sense. pdca"

**Understanding Applied:** Separate requirements mapping from planning and merge all timestamped planning files with logical priority order

1. **Requirements Extraction**: Move detailed requirements mapping to separate file
2. **Planning File Discovery**: Locate other timestamped planning files to merge
3. **Priority Analysis**: Organize tasks in logical priority order
4. **Document Structure**: Optimize planning document for clarity and usability
5. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure proper linking between planning and requirements files

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ✅ Requirements mapping in dedicated file for better organization
- ✅ All timestamped planning files merged with logical priority structure
- ✅ Improved document clarity and navigation
