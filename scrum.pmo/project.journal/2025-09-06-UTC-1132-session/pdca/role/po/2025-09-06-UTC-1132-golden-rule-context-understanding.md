### **QA Decisions Required:**

**Decision 1: Git State Resolution (Complete Context Provided Below)**
- a) Abort current rebase and restart traceability fix with smaller commits
- b) Force push to resolve conflicts (may lose concurrent changes)  
- c) Check current git state and resolve conflicts manually

### **User Feedback Received**
User correction: "4 2 means, you have to bring me into context as i bring you. do you know the golden rule? read your question to qa again and ask yourself if you could answer them in my shoes…"

**Critical Understanding Applied:** 
- **Golden Rule**: "Treat others as you would want to be treated"
- **4 2 = Context Sharing**: Bring you into context as you bring me
- **Bad Questions**: I asked questions I couldn't answer in your shoes without context

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
1. **Apply Golden Rule**: Provide context I would need to make informed decisions
2. **Context Sharing**: Give you complete information about git conflicts and repository state
3. **Informed Decisions**: Enable you to make decisions based on full context
4. **Proper 4 2**: Bring you into context as you bring me into project context

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ✅ Complete context provided for git conflict resolution
- ✅ Informed decision making enabled
- ✅ Proper application of Golden Rule and 4 2 principle
- ✅ Better collaborative decision making process

## **🔧 DO**

### **Complete Git Conflict Context**

#### **1. Current Git State (What I Can See)**
```
interactive rebase in progress; onto 1a42bf02
Last commands done (2 commands done):
   pick 6077abd0 Checkpoint before follow-up message
   pick c1039144 fix: Sprint 20 traceability links systematic fix - all task links now clickable

No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch 'dev/once0304' on '1a42bf02'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)
```

#### **2. Conflict Details**
**Conflicted File:**
- `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/task-21-defaultcli-web4-compliance-rebuild.md`

**Successfully Staged Changes (23 files):**
- task-1-ior-single-source-truth.md (traceability links fixed)
- task-10-web4tscomponent-version-management.md (traceability links fixed)
- task-11-simplify-unit-user-pattern.md (traceability links fixed)
- task-12-unit-ld-links-speaking-names.md (traceability links fixed)
- task-13-fix-existing-scenario-format.md (traceability links fixed + requirements enhanced)
- task-14-fix-central-storage-location.md (traceability links fixed + requirements enhanced)
- task-15-unit-model-separation.md (traceability links fixed)
- task-16 through task-26 (all traceability links fixed)
- [Plus PDCA documentation file]

#### **3. What the Fix Accomplished**
**Traceability Fix Applied to 24 Task Files:**
- **Before**: Links in code blocks (```) - not clickable
- **After**: Direct markdown links - fully clickable
- **Method**: Systematic removal of code block markers using sed
- **Result**: Enhanced Sprint 20 navigation and cross-referencing

**Example Fix:**
```
Before: 
```
  - up
    - [requirement:uuid:UUID](../file.md)
```

After:
**Up:**
- [requirement:uuid:UUID](../file.md)
```

#### **4. Conflict Cause Analysis**
**Likely Cause:**
- Concurrent changes to task-21-defaultcli-web4-compliance-rebuild.md
- My systematic sed fix conflicted with other modifications
- Rebase trying to apply my changes on top of newer changes

#### **5. Available Resolution Options**

**Option A: Abort and Restart (Safest)**
- `git rebase --abort` - Return to clean state
- Apply traceability fix to individual files in smaller commits
- Avoid conflicts by working incrementally

**Option B: Force Resolution (Risky)**
- Force push to override conflicts
- May lose concurrent changes from other agents
- Could cause data loss

**Option C: Manual Conflict Resolution (Detailed)**
- Examine specific conflict in task-21 file
- Manually resolve merge markers
- Continue rebase with resolved conflicts

#### **6. Current Repository Impact**
**Status:**
- **24 Files Successfully Fixed**: Traceability links now clickable
- **1 File Conflicted**: task-21-defaultcli-web4-compliance-rebuild.md
- **Commit Staged**: Ready to complete once conflict resolved
- **Branch State**: In middle of rebase operation

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Immediate Context Summary for Decision**

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ✅ **24 Task Files Fixed**: Traceability links now clickable
- ✅ **Navigation Enhanced**: Sprint 20 cross-referencing improved
- ✅ **Format Corrected**: Code blocks removed, proper markdown links

**Current Git Issue:**
- **Conflict**: task-21-defaultcli-web4-compliance-rebuild.md has merge conflict
- **Cause**: Concurrent changes during systematic fix
- **Status**: 24 files staged successfully, 1 file conflicted

**Resolution Trade-offs:**
- **Abort (Safest)**: No data loss, restart with incremental approach
- **Force (Risky)**: Quick resolution but may lose concurrent changes
- **Manual (Detailed)**: Examine specific conflict and resolve precisely

### **Golden Rule Applied**
I've provided the complete context you need to make an informed decision about git conflict resolution, just as you provide me context about the project and tasks.
