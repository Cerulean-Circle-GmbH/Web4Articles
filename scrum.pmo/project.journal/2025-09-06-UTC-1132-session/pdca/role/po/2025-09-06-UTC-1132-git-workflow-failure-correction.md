### **Critical Failure Analysis**
- **Issue**: Created multiple PDCA files but failed to commit/push them
- **Impact**: GitHub dual links non-functional, work not preserved
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete git workflow execution
- **User Impact**: Broken links, inability to access documented work
- **Process Violation**: Failed to complete basic git hygiene

### **Immediate Actions Required**
- **Commit**: All session work including PDCAs, planning cleanup, task updates
- **Push**: Make all work accessible via GitHub links
- **Verification**: Ensure all dual links are functional
- **Process Learning**: Establish proper git workflow habits

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Git Workflow Correction Strategy**
1. **Status Check**: Review all uncommitted changes
2. **Staging**: Add all session work to git staging
3. **Commit**: Create comprehensive commit message
4. **Push**: Upload all changes to remote repository
5. **Verification**: Test GitHub links functionality
6. **Process Improvement**: Document proper git workflow

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ✅ All session work committed and pushed
- ✅ GitHub dual links functional
- ✅ Work preserved and accessible
- ✅ Proper git workflow established
- ✅ User confidence in process reliability restored

## **🔧 DO**

### **Git Workflow Execution**

#### **1. Critical Failure Acknowledgment**
❌ **Process Failure:**
- Created comprehensive PDCA documentation
- Updated Sprint 20 planning and task files
- Provided GitHub dual links in all PDCAs
- **FAILED** to commit and push changes
- Result: All GitHub links broken, work not preserved

✅ **User Feedback Integration:**
- "does not work. did you do your git job?" - **Correct assessment**
- **My Responsibility**: Failed basic git workflow
- **Impact**: Undermined session quality and user experience
- **Learning**: Git commit/push is essential, not optional

#### **2. Current Git Status Assessment**
