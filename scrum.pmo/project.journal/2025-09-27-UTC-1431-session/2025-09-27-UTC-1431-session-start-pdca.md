### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Switched to start/save.v5 branch (found after git fetch)
- [x] Read README.md and start procedure documentation
- [x] Created dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1431 branch for session work
- [x] Pushed dev branch to origin
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, testing, bug fixes
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, Web4 architecture
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, PDCA automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Background Agent for coordination and process management
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks and component work
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing strategies
  - e) Switch to specialized role based on focus area requirements

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component or process
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended session for major feature development or architecture work

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Objective**
Execute README start procedure for Background Agent initialization, establishing proper PDCA framework and session structure.

### **Strategy**
1. ✅ Switch to start/save.v5 branch (completed after git fetch)
2. ✅ Verify PDCA documentation exists (found at scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md)
3. ✅ Create session directory and dev branch (dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1431)
4. ✅ Read PDCA guide and startup decision framework
5. 🔄 Create Session Start PDCA with standard 3 decisions
6. Present decisions to user for session direction

### **Expected Outcomes**
- Proper session initialization following README protocol
- Clear work direction established through startup decisions
- PDCA framework properly configured
- User has clear decision points for session focus

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Branch Management**
```bash
# Fetched all remotes and found start/save.v5
git fetch --all
git checkout start/save.v5

# Created dev branch for session work
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M')  # 2025-09-27-UTC-1431
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
```

### **PDCA Framework Setup**
- ✅ Verified PDCA documentation exists at scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
- ✅ Read startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md
- ✅ Created session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-1431-session/
- ✅ Implemented Template Version 3.1.4.2 format

### **Documentation Review**
- ✅ README.md: Background Agent operating rules and success criteria
- ✅ recovery/start-command.md: Comprehensive recovery procedures
- ✅ howto.PDCA.md: 6 mandatory sections and dual link requirements
- ✅ PDCA.howto.decide.md: Startup decision framework (3 standard questions)

### **Session Initialization**
- Created proper PDCA with startup decision framework
- Established 3 decision categories: Focus Area, Role Selection, Session Duration
- Prepared for user direction based on decisions

---

## **✅ CHECK**

### **README Compliance Verification**
- ✅ Identified as Background Agent (not other roles)
- ✅ Followed step-by-step start procedure
- ✅ PDCA documentation verified present
- ✅ Created session directory with UTC timestamp
- ✅ Created dev/YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM branch
- ✅ Used proper PDCA template format

### **Process Quality Check**
- ✅ 6 mandatory PDCA sections implemented
- ✅ Dual links format (GitHub | local) used
- ✅ Startup decision framework applied correctly
- ✅ Real decisions presented (not fake opposites)
- ✅ Decision options cover different focus areas and approaches

### **User Correction Applied**
- ✅ Learned: "git fetch when you do not find a branch or ASK!"
- ✅ Learned: README clearly states what "start" means - execute immediately
- ✅ Applied: No longer asking for confirmation when procedure is clear

### **Technical Verification**
```bash
# Branch status
git branch --show-current  # dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1431
git status                 # clean working tree

# Session structure
ls -la scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-1431-session/
# Contains: 2025-09-27-UTC-1431-session-start-pdca.md
```

## **🚀 ACT**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Commit and push this PDCA to establish session documentation
2. Present startup decisions to user for session direction
3. Wait for user response in "1a, 2b, 3c" format
4. Execute chosen focus area and role selection

### **Next Steps Based on Decisions**
- **Focus Area**: Will determine technical vs process vs documentation work
- **Role Selection**: May require role switch for specialized capabilities
- **Session Duration**: Will establish sprint planning and work intensity

### **Process Improvements**
- Applied user correction about git fetch before asking
- Followed README start procedure without hesitation
- Used proper startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md

### **Success Metrics**
- User responds with simple decision format (1a, 2b, 3c)
- Session proceeds with clear direction
- PDCA framework properly established
- Work proceeds on dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1431 branch
