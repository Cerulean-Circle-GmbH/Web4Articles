## **📋 PLAN**

**Git Repository Analysis Objectives:**
- Analyze recent commit history and development patterns
- Map active branch structure and relationships
- Identify current development focus areas
- Understand merge patterns and integration points
- Provide navigation overview for project context

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Recent commit history examination (last 15 commits)
2. Branch structure mapping (local and remote branches)
3. Merge pattern analysis with visual graph
4. Active development area identification
5. Sprint context integration

**Key Areas to Examine:**
- Current branch: `dev/2025-09-18-UTC-1711`
- Recent merge from `dev/req0305`
- Session summary tool development
- Unit system integration work
- Sprint-22 preparation activities

## **🔧 DO** 

**Git Log Analysis (Last 15 Commits):**

**Current Branch State:**
- **HEAD:** `dev/2025-09-18-UTC-1711` (2 commits ahead of origin)
- **Base Branch:** `cursor/start-background-process-0976` (600d87ad)
- **Recent Work:** Session start initialization and checkpoint

**Key Recent Commits:**
1. **e7434c8e** - Checkpoint before follow-up message (HEAD)
2. **eb38c720** - PDCA: Session Start - Background Agent Initialization
3. **600d87ad** - PDCA: Session Summary Tool Enhancement (origin/dev/once0304)
4. **2102299f** - MERGE: Complete integration from dev/req0305
5. **bf620b11** - PDCA: Complete Automation Achievement - sessionSummary Tool

**Major Integration Point:**
- **Commit 2102299f:** Large merge from `dev/req0305` integrating:
  - Agent work including code
  - MDAv4 structure updates
  - Unit system enhancements

**Branch Structure Analysis:**

**Active Development Branches:**
- `dev/2025-09-18-UTC-1711` (current session)
- `dev/once0304` (session summary work)
- `dev/req0305` (recently merged requirements work)
- `cursor/start-background-process-0976` (background agent base)

**Branch Categories Identified:**
