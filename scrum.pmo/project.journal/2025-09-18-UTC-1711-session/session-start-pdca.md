### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Git Configuration**: Completed git config pull.rebase false for collaborative safety
- [x] **Environment Setup**: Completed source source.env for Web4 tool availability
- [x] **Safety Guidelines**: Reviewed agent safety commands and non-interactive requirements
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) **Technical Development Focus** - Continue Sprint-22 Unit Foundation implementation
  - b) **Architecture Focus** - Design IOR object handling system architecture
  - c) **Documentation Focus** - Update PDCA processes and project documentation
  - d) **Quality/Testing Focus** - Implement testing framework for Unit system

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) **Developer** - Implementation of Sprint-22 Unit Foundation tasks
  - b) **Architect** - Design IOR object handling and auto-sync architecture
  - c) **Tester** - Quality assurance for Unit deduplication framework
  - d) **PO** - Requirements analysis and Sprint-22 task prioritization

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) **Full day session** - Complete multiple Sprint-22 tasks with PDCA cycles
  - b) **Half-day focused session** - Target specific Epic (E: Scenario/IOR Auto-Sync)
  - c) **Quick analysis session** - Project status assessment and next steps
  - d) **Extended multi-day session** - Comprehensive Sprint-22 implementation

### **My Answer**
Session initialized successfully with all mandatory startup steps completed. Ready for work focus and role selection.
**Learning Applied:** CMM4 process feedback through validation-first approach - understanding before instruction.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Current Project Context:**
- **Sprint:** Sprint-22 Unit Foundation (3-week sprint)
- **Focus:** IOR object handling with git file sources as primary use case
- **MVP:** IOR object handling for scenario.interface.ts and similar git files
- **Priority:** Epic E (Scenario/IOR Auto-Sync) is primary deliverable ⭐⭐

**Startup Process Completed:**
1. ✅ Git configuration (pull.rebase false) for collaborative safety
2. ✅ Agent safety guidelines reviewed (non-interactive commands)
3. ✅ Git process cleanup executed (background process)
4. ✅ Environment sourcing (source.env) for Web4 tools
5. ✅ PDCA framework initialized and essential guide reviewed
6. ✅ Tech stack constraints understood (Vitest mandatory, Jest BANNED)

**Decision Framework Application:**
- Present 3 standard startup decisions for user guidance
- Focus on Sprint-22 Unit Foundation context
- Consider Epic E (Scenario/IOR Auto-Sync) as primary deliverable
- Apply "Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)" principle - collaborative decision making

**Next Steps Planning:**
- Create project.status.md with current state assessment
- Create new dev branch for session work
- Wait for user decision responses (1a, 2b format)
- Proceed with selected focus area and role
