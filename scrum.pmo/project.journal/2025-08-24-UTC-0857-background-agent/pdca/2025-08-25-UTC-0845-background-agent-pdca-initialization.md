- [x] **Completed Decision:** Used project journal path format: 2025-08-24-UTC-0857-background-agent as specified
- [x] **Decision 2b - COMPLETED:** Focus on essential documentation with links to external references
  - Created centralized external references hub at `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/external-references/`
  - All external references collected in ONE location using symbolic links for easy access
- [ ] **Decision 1: PDCA Content Focus**
  - a) Focus on technical process setup and branch management aspects

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-25-UTC-0845)**
```quote
read /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md.
and follow it dilligently.
then create a new dev/utc  

create a corresponding session in e.g.
scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-UTC-0857-background-agent/pdca
where you store your new pdca and report it.

1b
1b but make sure the external references is in ONE location and easy to find.
if you would need to create such a location 
create it here /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared and ln command the external references you need and collect them here.
```

### **My Answer**
I've read the PDCA howto.PDCA.md thoroughly and am following all 6 mandatory sections diligently. Created new dev/UTC branch (dev/2025-08-25-UTC-0845) and corresponding session structure as requested. For Decision 2b, I created a centralized external references hub at `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/external-references/` with symbolic links to all key PDCA documentation, making external references easy to find in ONE location.

**Learning Applied:** Strict adherence to PDCA format requirements ensures systematic process improvement and maintains excellent traceability across all project phases.
