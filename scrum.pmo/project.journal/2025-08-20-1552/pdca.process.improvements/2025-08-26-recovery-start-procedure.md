# PDCA Entry: Recovery Start Procedure

## Header
- **Date**: 2025-08-26
- **Objective**: Execute recovery start procedure to establish optimal PDCA workflow
- **Role**: Background Agent (Cursor)
- **GitHub Issues**: N/A
- **Related Commits**: Initial setup on dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036

## Summary
- **Links**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036/scrum.pmo/project.journal/Web4xDefinitionSession/pdca.process.improvements/2025-08-26-recovery-start-procedure.md) | [local](scrum.pmo/project.journal/Web4xDefinitionSession/pdca.process.improvements/2025-08-26-recovery-start-procedure.md)
- **QA Decisions**: All clear, no decisions to make - standard recovery procedure executed
- **User Feedback**: User typed "start" triggering recovery procedure

## Plan
Execute recovery start procedure as defined in recovery/start-command.md:
1. Check current branch and switch to save/start if needed
2. Verify PDCA documentation exists
3. Create dev/[UTC timestamp] branch for session work
4. Install git automation hooks
5. Document the recovery process

Expected outcomes:
- Working on dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036 branch
- PDCA workflow established
- Git automation configured
- Ready for productive work

## Do
1. **Checked current branch**: Was on cursor/start-background-process-50c1
2. **Switched to save/start**: Successfully switched as per recovery rules
3. **Created dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036**: New timestamped branch for session work
4. **Installed post-commit hook**: Auto-merge functionality ready
5. **Created this PDCA**: Documenting the recovery process

Commands executed:
```bash
# Check branch
git branch --show-current  # showed cursor/*

# Switch to save/start
git checkout save/start

# Create timestamped branch
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP

# Install post-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "ðŸ”„ Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "ðŸ“‹ Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

## Check
âœ… Successfully switched from cursor/* to save/start branch
âœ… Created and pushed dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036 branch
âœ… Git post-commit hook installed and made executable
âœ… PDCA documentation exists at scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
âœ… Recovery procedure completed successfully

Current status:
- Working branch: dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036
- PDCA workflow: Established
- Git automation: Configured
- Background Agent: Ready for tasks

## Act
Next steps:
1. Await user instructions for actual work tasks
2. Create PDCAs for all significant work
3. Use minimal chat reporting with dual links
4. Present numbered decisions when real choices exist
5. Maintain dev/2025-08-26-UTC-2036 throughout session

Improvements for future:
- Recovery procedure executed smoothly
- All checklist items completed
- Ready for productive work on Web4Articles DAPP
