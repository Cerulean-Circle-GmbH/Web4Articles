### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-26-UTC-2043)**
```quote
cherry 🍒 pick roles shared pdca from release/dev and read and understand the updates to follow them. prove it by a correct pdca reporting
```

### **My Answer**
I've cherry-picked the roles/_shared/PDCA directory and carefully studied the mandatory format requirements. This PDCA demonstrates my understanding by following the exact 6-section structure with proper headers, dual links, horizontal separators, and all required elements as specified in howto.PDCA.md.

**Learning Applied:** PDCA format has 6 mandatory sections with strict requirements - no variations allowed until achieving CMM 3 compliance

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute cherry-pick operation and create format-compliant PDCA

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Cherry-pick Operation:** Retrieve latest PDCA documentation from release/dev
- **Format Study:** Carefully read howto.PDCA.md and template.md
- **Compliance Demonstration:** Create PDCA following exact mandatory format

---

## **🔧 DO**

**1. Cherry-pick Execution**
```bash
git fetch origin release/dev
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
```

**2. Format Requirements Identified**
- 6 mandatory sections: Header, Summary, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- Strict header format with UTC timestamp
- Dual link format: [GitHub](URL) | local/path
- Horizontal separators between sections
- Verbatim TRON quotes in Summary
- QA decisions with checkboxes

**3. Key Learnings from howto.PDCA.md**
- Always use YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM format
- Include previous commit SHA for traceability
- Never paraphrase TRON feedback - use exact quotes
- Follow template EXACTLY - no "improvements" until CMM 3
