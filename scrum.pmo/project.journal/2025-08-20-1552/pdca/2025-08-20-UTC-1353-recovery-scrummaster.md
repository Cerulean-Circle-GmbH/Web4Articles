### QA Decisions
- [x] Recovery session created: 2025-08-20-1552
- [x] ScrumMaster role path followed (minimal setup)
- [x] Current sprint status assessed (Sprint 19 active)
- [ ] Impediments identified and prioritized
- [ ] Next sprint planning reviewed

---

## Plan
- Recover via V4 fast track ScrumMaster path (5 min target)
- Skip branch switching per multi-agent environment constraint
- Identify role: ScrumMaster (impediment removal focus)
- Current task: Check sprint-19 status and remove blocking dependencies
- Review impediment patterns from sprint-5 (multiple blocking dependencies found)

---

## Do
- ✅ Created recovery session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-20-1552
- ✅ Reviewed ScrumMaster process.md (30 lines) - CMMI Level 4 focus
- ✅ Assessed sprint structure: Sprint 0-19 active, Sprint 19 current
- ✅ Identified blocking pattern: Sprint-5 tasks had multiple blocking dependencies
- ✅ Found 17 impediment references mostly in sprint-5 task dependencies
- 📋 Created this PDCA for recovery documentation and traceability
- 🎯 Ready to remove impediments and facilitate team velocity

---

## Check
> User feedback: "recover from /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.v4.md as scrum master. make sure you do not switch branches as we are in an environment with multiple concurrent agents. do all but branch switching."

**Verification:**
- ✅ Recovery completed without branch switching
- ✅ ScrumMaster role successfully assumed  
- ✅ Multi-agent environment constraint respected
- ✅ V4 recovery process followed (under 6 minutes)
- ✅ PDCA created per mandatory requirement
- 🔍 Ready to identify current sprint impediments

---

## Act
**Next Steps:**
1. Review Sprint 19 planning.md for active impediments
2. Assess current TSRanger v2.2 testing status (based on branch name)
3. Identify blocking dependencies in multi-agent workflow
4. Coordinate with concurrent agents to remove impediments
5. Update sprint status and facilitate team velocity

**Process Improvements:**
- Multi-agent recovery protocol successfully tested
- V4 recovery process works efficiently with concurrent agents
- ScrumMaster role ideal for coordination in multi-agent environments

---

## PDCA Process Update
- **Recovery Success**: ScrumMaster V4 fast track completed in under 6 minutes
- **Multi-Agent Compatibility**: Recovery process works without branch conflicts
- **Documentation**: PDCA created with proper traceability and dual links
- **Next Focus**: Sprint impediment removal and team coordination

---

🚀 **Recovery Complete**: ScrumMaster ready for impediment removal in multi-agent environment
