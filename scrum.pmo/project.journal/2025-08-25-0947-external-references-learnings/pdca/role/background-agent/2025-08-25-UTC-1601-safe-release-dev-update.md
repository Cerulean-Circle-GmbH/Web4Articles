# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Safe Update of release/dev with Unmerged Branches**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-25-UTC-1601  
**🎯 Objective:** Safely update release/dev with unmerged branches without destroying anything  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Release Integration Safety Officer  
**🚨 Issues:** Need to merge multiple unmerged branches while preserving release/dev integrity

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1:** Proceed with release/dev update
  - [ ] 1a: Create integration branch first (SAFE)
  - [ ] 1b: Update release/dev directly (RISKY)
- [ ] **Decision 2:** Merge strategy
  - [ ] 2a: Selective cherry-pick of safe changes
  - [ ] 2b: Full merge with conflict resolution
- [ ] **Decision 3:** Safety confirmation
  - [ ] 3a: Implement all safety checks
  - [ ] 3b: Skip some checks (NOT RECOMMENDED)

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-25-UTC-1600)**
```quote
then try to update release/dev with the unmerged branches without destroying anything on release/dev.

then creta a new branch repport with a  utc timestamp
```

### **My Answer**
This is a CRITICAL operation that requires following the CI/CD safety protocols discovered in my research. According to the CICDAgent process, I must:
1. Check that NO other agents are active
2. Create an integration branch first (not update release/dev directly)
3. Test merges before applying to release/dev
4. Generate comprehensive branch report after operations

**Learning Applied:** Never perform direct operations on release/dev. Always use integration branches and safety checks.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Safety Protocol (from research):**
1. ⏳ **Verify no active agents** - Critical safety check
2. ⏳ **Create integration branch** - cursor/release-integration-UTC
3. ⏳ **Identify safe branches** - Analyze unmerged branches
4. ⏳ **Test merges** - Verify no destructive changes
5. ⏳ **Document operations** - Full audit trail
6. ⏳ **Create branch report** - New UTC-timestamped report

**Protected Paths (must not destroy):**
- `.github/workflows/**`
- `scrum.pmo/project.journal/**`
- `scrum.pmo/templates/**`
- `qa-feedback-log.md`
