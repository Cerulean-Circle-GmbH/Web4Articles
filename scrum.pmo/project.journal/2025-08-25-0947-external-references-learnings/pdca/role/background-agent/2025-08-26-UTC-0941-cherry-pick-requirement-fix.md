**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-26-UTC-0941  
**🎯 Objective:** Cherry-pick commit 785bdd1 from release/dev to restore requirement tool functionality  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Integration Fix Specialist  
**🚨 Issues:** Requirement tools not functional due to missing builds - release/dev agent provided fix  
**📎 Previous Commit:** 99f912c - 📝 Test requirement tool functionality - manual creation successful

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Pending:** Cherry-pick in progress
- [ ] **Pending:** Conflict resolution if needed
- [ ] **Pending:** Tool functionality verification

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-26-UTC-0940)**
```quote
Your background agent should cherry-pick 785bdd1 first - this will restore its requirement tool functionality

this is from release/dev  agent.
he tried to fix your problem.

do it but be carefull to not loose some of your changes locally.
```

### **My Answer**
Thank you for the guidance! I'll carefully cherry-pick commit 785bdd1 from release/dev, which contains the fix for the requirement tool. I'll ensure no local changes are lost by checking status first and handling any conflicts carefully.

**Learning Applied:** Collaborative fixes from other agents improve the whole system.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Cherry-pick Strategy:**
1. ⏳ **Check current status** - Ensure no uncommitted changes
2. ⏳ **Fetch latest** - Get commit 785bdd1 from release/dev
3. ⏳ **Cherry-pick carefully** - Apply the fix commit
4. ⏳ **Resolve conflicts** - If any, preserve important local changes
5. ⏳ **Test requirement tool** - Verify the fix works

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Step 1: Check Current Status**

```bash
$ git status --short
?? scrum.pmo/project.journal/.../2025-08-26-UTC-0941-cherry-pick-requirement-fix.md
```

Status clean - only new PDCA file present.

### **Step 2: Prepare and Fetch**

```bash
$ git add scrum.pmo/project.journal/.../2025-08-26-UTC-0941-cherry-pick-requirement-fix.md
$ git commit -m "📋 PDCA: Start cherry-pick of requirement tool fix"
[dev/2025-08-25-UTC-1308 ae255f9]

$ git fetch origin release/dev
From https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles
   b5598a1..0d5df81  release/dev -> origin/release/dev
```

### **Step 3: Cherry-pick Commit 785bdd1**

```bash
$ git cherry-pick 785bdd1
CONFLICT (file location): spec/requirements.md/7628c6c9... added in wrong location
CONFLICT (file location): spec/requirements.md/deb46b62... added in wrong location  
CONFLICT (modify/delete): spec/requirements.md/00_requirements.overview.md
```

**Conflicts encountered:**
- Two requirement files added in wrong directory path
- Overview file deleted in our branch but modified in cherry-pick

### **Step 4: Resolve Conflicts**

```bash
$ git rm components/Web4ChangeRequest/0.1.0.0/latest/spec/requirements.md/*.requirement.md
$ git rm spec/requirements.md/00_requirements.overview.md
```

Removed conflicting files that were in incorrect locations.

### **Step 5: Continue Cherry-pick**

```bash
$ git cherry-pick --continue
[Terminal became unresponsive during operation]
```

**Status:** Cherry-pick operation appears to have hung during completion. The fix for Unit component package.json appears to be partially applied based on file inspection.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"cherry-pick 785bdd1 first - this will restore its requirement tool functionality"**

**Cherry-pick Results:**
- ⚠️ **Partial Success:** Unit package.json changes appear applied
- ❌ **Terminal Issue:** Git operation hung during cherry-pick continue
- ✅ **Conflicts Resolved:** Removed incorrectly placed requirement files
- ⏳ **Status Unknown:** Cherry-pick may need completion or abort

**Technical Issue:**
Terminal became unresponsive during `git cherry-pick --continue`, preventing completion of the operation.

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Current Situation**

**What Happened:**
1. Successfully fetched commit 785bdd1 from release/dev
2. Started cherry-pick operation
3. Encountered expected conflicts with requirement file locations
4. Resolved conflicts by removing incorrectly placed files
5. Terminal hung when continuing cherry-pick

**Observed Changes:**
- Unit component package.json appears modified (empty dependencies block visible)
- Several scenario files were staged for commit
- PDCA from release/dev agent was included

**Recommendation:**
Need to either:
1. Abort cherry-pick and retry with different strategy
2. Complete cherry-pick if terminal recovers
3. Manually apply the critical Unit component fix

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: TECHNICAL CHALLENGES**

### **Frustration:**
**MODERATE** - Terminal hanging prevents clean completion.

### **Learning:**
**VALUABLE** - Complex cherry-picks with structural conflicts need careful handling.

### **Persistence:**
**REQUIRED** - Will find alternative approach if needed.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Successfully identified and resolved file location conflicts
- ⚠️ **Terminal Stability:** Git operations can hang on complex cherry-picks
- ✅ **Collaborative Fixes:** Other agents' fixes are valuable but may need adaptation
- ⏳ **Incomplete State:** Need recovery strategy for hung operations

**Quality Impact:** Partial application of fix - may need manual intervention.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Complete or recover from hung cherry-pick operation.

**🎯 Cherry-pick initiated but hung - Unit fix partially applied.** ⚠️🔧

**"Never 2 1 (TO ONE). Always 4 2 (FOR TWO) - collaborative fixes need patience."** 🤝⏳
