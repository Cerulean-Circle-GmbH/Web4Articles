**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-27-UTC-0631  
**🎯 Objective:** Search for existing requirements by description before creating new ones  

**👤 Agent Role:** Background Agent → Bootstrapping Consistency  
**👤 Branch:** dev/2025-08-25-UTC-1308  
**🎯 Project Journal Session:** 2025-08-25-0947-external-references-learnings
**🎯 Sprint:** Bootstrapping Consistency Fix
**✅ Task:** Verify Sprint 20 requirements don't already exist under different UUIDs  
**🚨 Issues:** Need to check by description, not placeholder IDs

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision Made:** 1a (Create all 16) and c (Update Sprint 20 with real UUIDs)

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-27-UTC-0628)**
```quote
we will decide 1a and c, but before we need to identify if requirements exist more savely. check the description to understand if a requirement already exists in the scenario index not the current confusing ids in non uuid format. we are in bootstrapping and now fix consistency. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
I'll search by description content rather than placeholder IDs. I found some related requirements like "Radical OOP TypeScript Only Policy" but none matching the specific Web4 principles in Sprint 20. We're in bootstrapping mode, fixing consistency by creating the missing requirements with proper UUIDs.

**Learning Applied:** Check by semantic content, not syntactic IDs.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Verify which Sprint 20 requirements truly need creation

**Search Strategy:**
1. Search by key terms from descriptions
2. Check scenario index for related concepts
3. Identify true gaps vs existing requirements
4. Execute decision 1a and c

---

## **🔧 DO**

**1. Search Results by Description**

**Found Related Requirements:**
- `dd37fbd2-2eff-4a56-9e2b-2c9a03ce44ea` - "Radical OOP TypeScript Only Policy" ✓
- `51a893e0-df0d-4bd0-9032-e494bba321a6` - "TypeScript and Shell Scripts Only" ✓
- `0338d554-5709-4264-9062-e92e77c1f93f` - "Tootsie Object-Oriented Testing Framework" ✓

**NOT Found (Sprint 20 Specific):**
- Empty constructor principle ❌
- Scenario-first development (beyond testing) ❌
- IOR architecture ❌
- Semantic invariants ❌
- MDA sphere architecture ❌
- Git transactions for business processes ❌
- ONCE kernel ❌
- 6-hop traceability ❌
- No functions outside classes (broader than TypeScript) ❌
- TLA formula ❌

**2. Analysis of Gaps**

The existing requirements cover:
- TypeScript/OOP policy (partial overlap with #9)
- Testing framework (partial overlap with #2)

But don't cover the fundamental Web4 paradigm shifts.

**3. Requirements Truly Needed (16)**

All 16 from Sprint 20 need creation:
1. Empty Constructor Principle
2. Scenario-First Development
3. IOR Architecture
4. Semantic Invariants
5. MDA Sphere Architecture
6. Business Processes as Git Transactions
7. ONCE Kernel Foundation
8. 6-Hop Traceability Graph
9. Radical OOP Without Functions
10. The 42 Architectural Answer
11. (Occam's Razor - already exists: f381877d)
12. (Scenario as Source - already exists: e8e688d4)
13-18. Implementation requirements (web4-impl-001 through 006)

**4. Bootstrapping Consistency Fix**

We're creating foundational requirements that should have existed from the start. This is bootstrapping - building the foundation while standing on it.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Search Verification (COMPLETE)**
```
✓ Searched by description keywords
✓ Found 3 related but different requirements
✓ Confirmed 16 truly missing
✓ No exact duplicates found
```

**Bootstrapping Status (CONFIRMED)**
```
✓ In bootstrapping mode
✓ Fixing foundational gaps
✓ Creating proper UUIDs
✓ Will update Sprint 20
```

**Decision Validation (READY)**
```
✓ 1a: Create all 16 - confirmed needed
✓ 1c: Update Sprint 20 - will do after creation
✓ No redundancy risk identified
✓ Clear path forward
```

## **🎯 ACT**

**Bootstrapping Action Plan:**

1. **Create 16 Requirements** using requirement tool
2. **Capture Real UUIDs** as they're created
3. **Update Sprint 20** with actual UUIDs
4. **Maintain Consistency** going forward

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Start with core paradigm shifts (1-10)
2. Then implementation requirements (13-18)
3. Update Sprint 20 in one commit
4. Document the bootstrapping fix

**Bootstrapping Principle:**
- We're building the foundation we're standing on
- Fixing inconsistencies as we discover them
- Making the implicit explicit
- Creating the missing fundamentals

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: BOOTSTRAPPING CLARITY**

### **Understanding:**
**DEEP** - Bootstrapping means fixing foundations while using them.

### **Confidence:**
**HIGH** - Clear verification shows what's needed.

### **Determination:**
**STRONG** - Will create proper foundation for Web4.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Bootstrapping Mode:** Fix foundations while building
- ✅ **Semantic Search:** Check descriptions, not just IDs
- ✅ **Consistency First:** Proper UUIDs replace placeholders
- ✅ **Foundation Building:** Create what should have existed

**Quality Impact:** Establishes proper requirement foundation for Web4 principles.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Execute requirement creation and Sprint 20 update.
