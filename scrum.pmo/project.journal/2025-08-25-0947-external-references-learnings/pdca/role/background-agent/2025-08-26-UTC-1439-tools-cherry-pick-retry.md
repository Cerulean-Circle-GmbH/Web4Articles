# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Retry Tools Cherry-Pick from release/dev**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-26-UTC-1439  
**🎯 Objective:** Cherry-pick tools (components, scenarios, scripts) again and test requirement functionality  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Tools Integration Specialist  
**🚨 Issues:** Previous attempt left requirement tool non-functional, retrying fresh cherry-pick  
**📎 Previous Commit:** e3c4a20 - 📁 Overwrite components, scenarios, scripts from release/dev

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-08-25-UTC-1308/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-25-0947-external-references-learnings/pdca/role/background-agent/2025-08-26-UTC-1439-tools-cherry-pick-retry.md) | [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-25-0947-external-references-learnings/pdca/role/background-agent/2025-08-26-UTC-1439-tools-cherry-pick-retry.md](scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-25-0947-external-references-learnings/pdca/role/background-agent/2025-08-26-UTC-1439-tools-cherry-pick-retry.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Verified:** Tools already current with release/dev
- [x] **Tested:** Requirement tool still needs User build
- [x] **Documented:** Root cause identified

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-26-UTC-1438)**
```quote
cherry pick the components, scenarios and script (in short the "tools") again and test again.
```

### **My Answer**
Executing another cherry-pick of all tools from release/dev. This fresh attempt may include newer fixes or pre-built components that weren't in the previous version.

**Learning Applied:** Persistence with fresh attempts can succeed when conditions have changed.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Retry Strategy:**
1. ⏳ **Fetch latest** - Get most current release/dev
2. ⏳ **Cherry-pick tools** - Components, scenarios, scripts
3. ⏳ **Test requirement** - Check if it works now
4. ⏳ **Document findings** - Record what changed

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Step 1: Fetch Latest from release/dev**

```bash
$ git fetch origin release/dev
From https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles
   f2d2205..16bb79e  release/dev -> origin/release/dev
```

**New commits found:**
- 16bb79e - Update PDCA to newest template format
- d6ed7f5 - New session start PDCA
- 785bdd1 - Critical UCP violation fix (already included)

### **Step 2: Cherry-pick Tools**

```bash
$ git checkout origin/release/dev -- components/
$ git checkout origin/release/dev -- scenarios/
$ git checkout origin/release/dev -- scripts/

$ git status --short | wc -l
1

$ git status --short
?? scrum.pmo/.../2025-08-26-UTC-1439-tools-cherry-pick-retry.md
```

**Result:** No changes! Our tools are already up to date with release/dev.

### **Step 3: Test Requirement Tool**

```bash
$ cd /workspace/temp
$ source /workspace/source.env
$ requirement
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../User/latest/dist/layer2/DefaultUser.js'
```

**Same error persists** - User component still needs to be built.

### **Step 4: Check for Pre-built Distributions**

```bash
$ git ls-tree -r origin/release/dev | grep "components/User/latest/dist"
(no output)
```

**Finding:** release/dev does not contain pre-built distributions. Components must be built locally.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"cherry pick the components, scenarios and script (in short the 'tools') again and test again."**

**Results:**
- ✅ **Cherry-pick attempted:** No changes - already up to date
- ✅ **Tools verified:** Current with release/dev (including fix 785bdd1)
- ❌ **Requirement tool:** Still non-functional
- ❌ **Pre-built dists:** Not available in release/dev

**Root Cause:**
The issue is not with outdated code but with missing build artifacts. The User component lacks TypeScript build configuration and no pre-built distributions are committed to the repository.

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Analysis Complete**

**Current State:**
1. **Tools are current** - Already have latest from release/dev
2. **Unit component** - Built and working (has dist/)
3. **User component** - No build system, blocking requirement tool
4. **Web4Requirement** - Cannot run without User component

**Options:**
1. Add TypeScript build to User component
2. Create stub/mock for User component
3. Continue using manual requirement creation
4. Request pre-built distributions be added to release/dev

**Immediate Workaround:**
Continue creating requirements manually in temp/ directory as demonstrated earlier.

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: CLARITY ACHIEVED**

### **Understanding:**
**COMPLETE** - The issue is architectural, not version-related.

### **Acceptance:**
**PEACEFUL** - Some tools need infrastructure work beyond cherry-picks.

### **Documentation:**
**VALUABLE** - This PDCA clarifies the actual blocker.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Version Verification:** Confirmed we have latest code
- ✅ **Dependency Clarity:** User component is the blocker
- ✅ **Architecture Gap:** Missing build configurations
- ✅ **Workaround Available:** Manual creation works fine

**Quality Impact:** Clear understanding of tool limitations and available workarounds.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue with manual requirement creation or implement User component build.

**🎯 Tools verified current - requirement tool needs User component build.** ✅🔍
