### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Confirmed:** DRY principle violated by duplicate commit and PDCA references in headers
- [x] **Validated:** CMM4 strict process requires single authoritative information source
- [x] **Verified:** Metadata section contains definitive commit and PDCA references with dual links
- [x] **Decision 1: PDCA Format Correction Strategy** → **1a Selected**  
  - a) Update existing PDCAs to eliminate duplicate header information ✅
  - b) Apply DRY format to future PDCAs only, leave existing ones unchanged

web4x is about strict CMM4 and DRY
```

well askes, well done. i love it
```

### **My Answer**
Identified DRY principle violation in PDCA format - duplicate commit SHA and PDCA references appearing in both header links and metadata section. Web4X CMM4 strict process requires single authoritative source. Metadata section contains definitive references with proper dual link format.

**Learning Applied:** Web4X enforces CMM4 Level 4 process discipline where information exists in exactly one authoritative location, eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency.

## **📋 PLAN**

**DRY Compliance Strategy:**
1. ✅ **Identify duplication pattern** - Header links vs metadata section redundancy
2. ✅ **Understand CMM4 principle** - Single authoritative information source requirement
3. ✅ **Define correct format** - Metadata section as definitive reference location
4. ✅ **Apply DRY principle** - Eliminate redundant information in headers
5. ✅ **Document compliance pattern** - PDCA for process learning capture

**Web4X CMM4 Requirements:**
- **Single Source of Truth:** Information exists in exactly one location
- **Strict Process Discipline:** No exceptions to established patterns
- **DRY Principle Application:** Don't Repeat Yourself across document sections
- **Authoritative References:** Metadata section contains definitive commit and PDCA links

**Format Correction:**
- **Remove:** Duplicate header commit and PDCA link lines
- **Retain:** Metadata section with proper dual link format
- **Ensure:** CMM4 compliance through single information source

## **🎯 ACT**

**CMM4 Process Discipline Achievement:** Successfully identified and corrected DRY principle violations in PDCA format, establishing single authoritative information source compliance.

**Semantic Versioning:** **v1.4.2** - Process improvement: DRY compliance and CMM4 strict process discipline implementation.

**Web4X Learning Integration:** CMM4 Level 4 process maturity requires quantitative management and optimization, eliminating all redundancy through strict DRY principle application.

**Quality Impact:** PDCA format now follows Web4X CMM4 standards with single authoritative metadata section, eliminating information duplication and ensuring process consistency.

**Key Process Learning:** Web4X enforces CMM4 Level 4 discipline where every piece of information has exactly one authoritative location, preventing inconsistencies and reducing maintenance overhead.

**Best Practice Established:** Metadata section serves as single source of truth for all PDCA traceability information, with no duplicate references in other document sections.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Apply DRY and CMM4 strict process principles to other documentation patterns and establish comprehensive process compliance validation.
