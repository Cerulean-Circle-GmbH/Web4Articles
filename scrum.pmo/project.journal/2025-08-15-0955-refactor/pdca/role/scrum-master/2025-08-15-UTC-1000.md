# PDCA Cycle: Recovery Process Documentation Update - 2025-08-15-UTC-1000

## Plan

**Objective:** Update recovery process documentation to implement new session-based PDCA workflow  
**Scope:** Modify recovery-process.md to integrate new PDCA organization within project journal sessions  
**Task Type:** Documentation update for process improvement  
**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes  

**Specific Changes Required:**
1. Update Phase 3 (Journal Entry Creation) to create new PDCA folder structure
2. Modify PDCA creation steps to use session-based organization
3. Add role transition documentation requirements
4. Update task-level PDCA creation guidelines
5. Integrate session lifecycle management

**Target Files:**
- `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md`
- Integration with new session template structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Recovery process creates session-based PDCA structure
- [x] Role transitions are properly documented
- [x] Task-level PDCA creation is specified
- [x] Session lifecycle management is integrated
- [x] Backward compatibility notes are included

## Do

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Analysis of Current Recovery Process** ✅
   - Reviewed existing recovery-process.md structure
   - Identified Phase 3 (Journal Entry Creation) as primary integration point
   - Located PDCA creation steps requiring modification

2. **Recovery Process Integration Completed** ✅
   - Updated Phase 3 to "Session-Based Journal Entry Creation"
   - Integrated session directory creation with PDCA structure
   - Added session start PDCA creation with proper templates
   - Implemented role transition PDCA documentation
   - Enhanced tree.index.md to include PDCA structure references

**Specific Implementation:**
```bash
# New session-based journal creation
SESSION_TYPE="${SESSION_TYPE:-recovery}"
JOURNAL_DIR="/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/${TIMESTAMP}-${SESSION_TYPE}"
mkdir -p "$JOURNAL_DIR/pdca/"{role-transitions,tasks,session}

# Session start PDCA creation
UTC_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
cat > "$JOURNAL_DIR/pdca/session/${UTC_TIMESTAMP}-session-start.md" << EOF
# PDCA Cycle: Recovery Session Start - ${UTC_TIMESTAMP}
# [Complete PDCA template with Plan/Do/Check/Act structure]
EOF

# Role transition PDCA (conditional)
if [ ! -z "$PREVIOUS_ROLE" ] && [ "$PREVIOUS_ROLE" != "$TARGET_ROLE" ]; then
  cat > "$JOURNAL_DIR/pdca/role-transitions/${UTC_TIMESTAMP}-${PREVIOUS_ROLE}-to-${TARGET_ROLE}.md"
  # [Complete role transition documentation]
fi
```

## Check

**Evidence of Completion:**
```bash
# Recovery process successfully updated
grep -A 20 "### Phase 3: Session-Based Journal Entry Creation" scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md
# Shows complete integration of new PDCA structure

# Session structure properly implemented
ls -la scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-15-0955-refactor/pdca/
# role-transitions/  session/  tasks/
```

**Integration Validation:**
- ✅ **Session Directory Structure**: Creates timestamped session with PDCA folders
- ✅ **Session Start PDCA**: Automatic creation with proper template
- ✅ **Role Transition PDCA**: Conditional creation for role switches
- ✅ **Tree Index Enhancement**: PDCA structure references added
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

**Requirements Compliance Check:**
- ✅ Requirement 1: Every recovery creates new project journal session
- ✅ Requirement 3: Agents create PDCAs in project journal session
- ✅ Requirement 4: Role switching documented in PDCA
- ✅ Requirement 5: New role creates PDCA for tasks
- ✅ Requirement 6: Good folder structure implemented
- ✅ Requirement 7: Recovery process documentation updated

## Act

**Task Completed Successfully** ✅

**Recovery Process Enhancement Summary:**
1. **Session-Based Structure**: Recovery now creates timestamped sessions with PDCA organization
2. **Automatic PDCA Creation**: Session start and role transition PDCAs generated automatically
3. **Improved Traceability**: Complete session lifecycle documentation
4. **Role Transition Support**: Explicit documentation for role switches
5. **Enhanced Tree Index**: PDCA structure visibility in repository overview

**Integration Benefits:**
- Better timeline-based view of recovery activities
- Explicit role transition documentation
- Session-level coordination and tracking
- Improved multi-agent workflow support
- Complete audit trail of recovery processes

**Next Steps for Template Updates:**
- Update Recovery Definition Agent templates to reference new session structure
- Ensure template examples use new PDCA organization
- Validate complete workflow with new structure

**TASK STATUS: Completed - Recovery process documentation successfully updated with session-based PDCA workflow integration**
