# PDCA Cycle: PDCA Structure Simplification - 2025-08-15-UTC-1958

## Plan

**Objective:** Simplify PDCA reporting structure from complex session/tasks/role-transitions to simple role-based organization  
**User Request (Verbatim):** 
> "i do not like the pdca reporing folders do pdca role scrum-master [utc].md other roles .... no session no task no long names. refactor it and make it the default in the processes."

**New Structure Design:**
```
pdca/
└── role/
    ├── scrum-master/
    │   └── [utc].md
    ├── developer/
    │   └── [utc].md
    └── other-roles/
        └── [utc].md
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Remove complex session/tasks/role-transitions directories
- [x] Create simple role-based structure
- [x] Use only UTC timestamps as filenames (no long descriptive names)
- [x] Update recovery process to use new structure
- [x] Update Recovery Definition Agent templates
- [x] Document the refactoring in PDCA using new structure

## Do

**Actions Taken:**

1. **PDCA Structure Refactoring** ✅
   - Moved all existing PDCAs from complex structure to `pdca/role/scrum-master/`
   - Renamed files to simple UTC timestamps:
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-0955.md` (session start)
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-1000.md` (recovery process update)
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-1002.md` (session completion)
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-1015.md` (template updates)
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-1512.md` (workspace documentation)
     - `2025-08-15-UTC-1945.md` (workspace integration)

2. **Removed Complex Directory Structure** ✅
   - Deleted `pdca/session/` directory
   - Deleted `pdca/tasks/` directory  
   - Deleted `pdca/role-transitions/` directory
   - Simplified to `pdca/role/` only

3. **Recovery Process Updates** ✅
   - Updated Phase 3 to create `pdca/role/${TARGET_ROLE,,}/` structure
   - Modified PDCA creation to use simple UTC filenames
   - Removed complex session/task organization
   - Updated role transition handling to use role-based structure

4. **Recovery Definition Agent Updates** ✅
   - Updated process.md to reference `pdca/role/recovery-definition-agent/`
   - Modified templates to use simplified structure
   - Changed naming convention to simple UTC timestamps
   - Updated navigation paths for new structure

5. **Project State Updates** ✅
   - Updated session documentation references
   - Simplified links to new PDCA structure
   - Maintained workspace documentation references

## Check

**Evidence of Simplification:**
```bash
# New simplified structure
tree scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-15-0955-refactor/pdca/
└── role
    └── scrum-master
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-0955.md
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-1000.md
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-1002.md
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-1015.md
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-1512.md
        ├── 2025-08-15-UTC-1945.md
        └── 2025-08-15-UTC-1958.md  # This refactoring PDCA
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Structure Simplified**: From 3 complex directories to 1 role-based directory
- ✅ **Naming Simplified**: From long descriptive names to simple UTC timestamps
- ✅ **Recovery Process Updated**: New structure integrated in Phase 3
- ✅ **Templates Updated**: Recovery Definition Agent templates use new structure
- ✅ **User Requirements Met**: Exact structure requested implemented

**Process Benefits:**
- ✅ **Cleaner Organization**: Role-based grouping more intuitive
- ✅ **Simpler Navigation**: Fewer directory levels
- ✅ **Cleaner Filenames**: UTC timestamps only, no long descriptions
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Simplified structure easier to manage

## Act

**PDCA Structure Simplification Completed** ✅

**Refactoring Summary:**
1. **Structure Transformation**: Complex 3-directory system → Simple role-based organization
2. **Filename Simplification**: Long descriptive names → Simple UTC timestamps
3. **Process Integration**: Recovery process updated for new structure
4. **Template Updates**: All Recovery Definition Agent templates updated
5. **Complete Migration**: All existing PDCAs moved to new structure

**New Default Structure for All Future Sessions:**
```
pdca/
└── role/
    ├── scrum-master/
    │   └── [UTC-timestamp].md
    ├── developer/
    │   └── [UTC-timestamp].md
    ├── po/
    │   └── [UTC-timestamp].md
    ├── tester/
    │   └── [UTC-timestamp].md
    └── [other-roles]/
        └── [UTC-timestamp].md
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **User Satisfaction**: Exact structure requested implemented
- **Improved Usability**: Much simpler and cleaner organization
- **Better Maintenance**: Easier to navigate and manage
- **Role Clarity**: Clear separation by role responsibility
- **Simplified Automation**: Recovery process now simpler and more reliable

**Future PDCA Usage:**
- Create PDCAs in `pdca/role/[role-name]/`
- Use only UTC timestamps as filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM.md`
- Role names should be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `scrum-master`, `recovery-definition-agent`)
- Each role gets its own directory for complete separation

---

**REFACTORING STATUS: Completed - PDCA structure simplified to role-based organization with UTC timestamp filenames as requested**
