## **üìä Summary**

**ENHANCED RECOVERY INTEGRITY MISSION ACTIVATED**

User directive: "your role is to always keep the integrity of the recovery. so on every prompt check the release/dev for news and merge them in. check the changes and the integrity of the process. simulate or test the recovery process in different agent roles. add git actions that make keep the integrity of the recovery. make sure your recovery procedures are always up to date on the production branch and the main branch."

**Critical Discovery**: Recent ScrumMaster improvements include agent-specific journal overviews and enhanced isolation - EXCELLENT for recovery integrity!
