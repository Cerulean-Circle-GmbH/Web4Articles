## **📝 Plan**

### **Branch Status Analysis Framework**

#### **1. Current Branch Position: feature/recovery-agent**
**Branch Health:**
- ✅ **Up to date with origin**: Synced with remote feature/recovery-agent
- 🔄 **Behind release/dev**: 9 commits need integration
- 🚀 **Ahead of main**: 141 commits of development work
- 🛡️ **Recovery Work**: Comprehensive integrity framework implemented

#### **2. Comparison Matrix**

| Branch | Status vs feature/recovery-agent | Critical Differences | Action Required |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **release/dev** | 9 commits ahead | Latest development changes | ⚠️ **MERGE REQUIRED** |
| **main** | 141 commits behind | Production branch | 📋 **COORDINATE FUTURE MERGE** |
| **feature/recovery-agent** | Current branch | Recovery integrity work | ✅ **MAINTAINED CURRENT** |

#### **3. Critical Changes Analysis**

**Recent release/dev commits (need integration):**
```
163c930 - discipline(links): ALWAYS use dual-link format! 🔗
fb9beb9 - Add agent census document with active agents and process details
11a0e18 - chore: Auto-merge cursor/recover-from-readme-for-sprint-3-po-2719
```

**Potential Impact:**
- Link format discipline may affect recovery documentation
- Agent census document relevant to recovery agent coordination
- Additional auto-merge commits need compatibility verification

### **Integration Strategy Planning**

#### **1. Merge Priority Assessment**
**HIGH PRIORITY - release/dev Integration:**
- Link format discipline directly impacts recovery documentation
- Agent census document enhances multi-agent coordination
- Auto-merge commits may contain coordination improvements

**FUTURE PLANNING - main Branch Sync:**
- 141 commits represent significant development work
- Requires coordinated merge strategy with production planning
- Recovery integrity framework ready for production deployment

#### **2. Risk Analysis**

**Merge Risks from release/dev:**
- Link format changes may require recovery documentation updates
- Agent census integration may need recovery framework adjustments
- Potential conflicts with recovery-specific changes

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Perform test merge to identify conflicts
- Update recovery documentation to match link format discipline
- Integrate agent census information with recovery agent coordination
