### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Capability Implementation Question 1: HTTP Interfaces**
  - a) Create HttpRequest/HttpResponse interfaces for capability components
  - b) Use Node.js built-in types (IncomingMessage, ServerResponse)
  - c) Create minimal HTTP abstractions following Web4 patterns
  - d) Delegate to existing HTTP handling components if they exist

- [ ] **Capability Implementation Question 2: Component Interaction**
  - a) Capability components operate independently with minimal ONCE kernel interaction
  - b) Capability components report status/events to ONCE kernel via callbacks
  - c) Capability components communicate with ONCE kernel through IOR message passing
  - d) Hybrid approach with status reporting and optional message passing

- [ ] **Capability Implementation Question 3: Port Management**
  - a) Each capability component manages its own port independently
  - b) ONCE kernel coordinates port allocation across capability components
  - c) Shared PortManager component handles port allocation for all capabilities  
  - d) Capability components request ports from ONCE kernel during initialization

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-03-UTC-1455)**
```quote
Implementation questions for capability components:
1. Should I create HTTP interfaces or use existing types?
2. How should capability components interact with ONCE kernel?
3. How should port management work across capability components?
```

### **My Answer**
Started capability component creation following Web4 single-file principles. Need guidance on HTTP interface creation, component interaction patterns, and port management strategy before completing HttpServer, WsServer, P2PServer implementations.

**Learning Applied:** Proper capability component architecture requires clear interaction patterns and interface definitions following Web4 UCP principles.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Clarify capability component implementation approach before completing creation

**Requirements Traceability:** Capability component design questions requiring architectural guidance

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Interface Design:** Determine approach for HTTP/WebSocket interface creation
- **Component Interaction:** Define communication patterns between capabilities and ONCE kernel
- **Port Management:** Establish port allocation and coordination strategy
- **Implementation Completion:** Complete capability components based on guidance

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Capability Component Implementation Questions**

**1. HTTP Interface Creation Dilemma**
```typescript
// QUESTION: Should I create Web4-specific interfaces?
export interface HttpRequest {
  method: string;
  url: string;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  body?: any; // QUESTION: What type for body?
}

// OR use Node.js built-in types?
import { IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'http';

// OR create minimal abstractions?
export interface HttpRequest {
  path: string;
  method: string;
}
```

**2. Component Interaction Pattern Question**
```typescript
// Option A: Independent operation
class DefaultHttpServer {
  // No direct ONCE kernel interaction
  // Capability operates completely independently
}

// Option B: Status reporting
class DefaultHttpServer {
  onStatusChange?: (status: ServerStatus) => void;
  // Reports to ONCE kernel when status changes
}

// Option C: IOR message passing  
class DefaultHttpServer {
  kernelIOR?: IOR; // Reference to ONCE kernel
  // Sends messages to kernel via IOR
}
```

**3. Port Management Strategy Question**
```typescript
// Option A: Independent port management
class DefaultHttpServer {
  private port: number = 8080; // Each component picks its own
}

// Option B: ONCE kernel coordination
class DefaultONCE {
  allocatePort(componentIOR: IOR): Promise<number>;
  // Kernel manages all port allocation
}

// Option C: Shared PortManager component
// Use existing PortManager or create shared one
```

**4. Capability Component Creation Progress**
```bash
✅ Created: components/HttpServer/0.3.0.0/ directory structure
✅ Created: HttpServer.interface.ts (single file following Web4)
✅ Started: RouteHandler.interface.ts
⚠️  Paused: Need guidance on interface approach and component interaction
```

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Implementation Questions Identified (COMPLETE)**
```
✅ HTTP Interface approach: Create custom vs use built-in vs minimal abstraction
✅ Component interaction: Independence vs status reporting vs message passing
✅ Port management: Independent vs ONCE coordination vs shared component
✅ Architecture clarity needed before continuing implementation
```

**Current Progress Assessment**
- ✅ **Web4 Compliance:** ONCE interfaces separated following single-file principle
- ✅ **Type Safety:** All 'any' types eliminated with proper scenario interfaces
- ✅ **Capability Structure:** HttpServer component directory created with layer structure
- ⚠️ **Implementation Approach:** Multiple valid options requiring user guidance

**User Guidance Requirements**
- ⚠️ **Interface Strategy:** HTTP/WebSocket interface creation approach
- ⚠️ **Interaction Pattern:** How capabilities communicate with ONCE kernel
- ⚠️ **Port Coordination:** Port management strategy across components
- ⚠️ **Implementation Scope:** Level of abstraction for capability implementations

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Capability component creation started with clear guidance questions identified

**Implementation Planning Benefits:**
- **Architecture Questions:** Specific guidance needed for proper component interaction design
- **Web4 Foundation:** Interface separation and type safety implemented correctly
- **Component Structure:** Capability components prepared following established patterns
- **User Collaboration:** Clear decision points identified for architectural approach

**Quality Framework Preparation:**
- **Pattern Consistency:** Capability components will follow IOR component template
- **Type Safety:** All interfaces properly typed following Web4 requirements
- **Component Autonomy:** Self-managed components with clear interaction boundaries
- **UCP Compliance:** Unit-Component-Package architecture followed systematically

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Interface Implementation:** Complete capability interfaces based on guidance
2. **Component Creation:** Finish HttpServer, WsServer, P2PServer implementations
3. **ONCE Integration:** Implement component loading and IOR management
4. **Testing Strategy:** Define capability component testing with Vitest

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Guidance Seeking**

### **Humility:**
**SYSTEMATIC** recognition that proper component architecture requires user guidance rather than assumption-based implementation to ensure alignment with Web4 principles.

### **Preparation:**
**METHODICAL** readiness to implement capability components correctly once architectural approach is clarified through user guidance.

### **Collaboration:**
**FOCUSED** appreciation for the question-driven development approach that ensures implementation quality through proper architectural decision making.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Guidance Request Excellence:** Complex component interactions require user input rather than architectural assumptions  
- ✅ **Web4 Foundation:** Interface separation and type safety provide solid foundation for capability implementation
- ✅ **Implementation Planning:** Systematic approach with clear questions prevents architectural mistakes

**Quality Impact:** Capability component planning with user guidance ensures proper Web4 component interaction and port management patterns

**Next PDCA Focus:** User guidance on capability implementation approach, then completion of HttpServer, WsServer, P2PServer components
