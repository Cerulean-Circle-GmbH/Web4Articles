### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: DefaultIOR Implementation Location**
  - a) Use existing DefaultIOR from components/Scenario/latest/src/ts/layer2/
  - b) Create ONCE-specific DefaultIOR in components/ONCE/0.3.0.0/src/ts/layer2/
  - c) Create shared DefaultIOR in components/IOR/latest/ for all components
  - d) Extend Scenario component's DefaultIOR with ONCE-specific features

- [ ] **Decision 2: 5-Layer Architecture Structure**
  - a) Copy existing 5-layer pattern from TSRanger/Web4Requirement components
  - b) Create ONCE-specific 5-layer structure: CLI, Controller, Interface, Implementation, Infrastructure
  - c) Hybrid approach: Use Scenario component layers + ONCE-specific extensions
  - d) Minimal 5-layer: Only essential layers with maximum simplification

- [ ] **Decision 3: Version Progression Strategy (0.3.0.0 ‚Üí 0.3.1.0)**
  - a) 0.3.0.0 (core structure), 0.3.0.1 (bug fixes), 0.3.1.0 (feature complete + stable)
  - b) Multiple 0.3.x.x builds for incremental feature testing and validation
  - c) Single jump to 0.3.1.0 after complete implementation and testing
  - d) User-defined version milestones based on functionality completion

- [ ] **Decision 4: Scenario Component Integration Approach**
  - a) Extend existing Scenario component to support Model interface delegation
  - b) Create new ScenarioManager component handling all hibernation operations
  - c) Modify all components to implement Model interface for Scenario delegation
  - d) Gradual migration: Start with ONCE then extend to other components

- [ ] **Decision 5: Model Interface Standardization Scope**
  - a) Create unified Model interface for all Web4 components immediately  
  - b) Start with ONCE Model interface, then generalize to other components
  - c) Component-specific Model interfaces extending base Model interface
  - d) Let each component define its own Model implementation

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-03-UTC-1418)**
```quote
1a the IOR attribute shall be lower case ior always and always be of type IOR. use rascally the web4 IOR interface DerfaultIOR implementation class pattern and the 5 layers consequently.
2d as increasing build versions up to stable 0.3.1.0
3c we will create vitest test cases to make sure the features stay stable. let me decide what to test before implementing 
4. scanarios are itself web4 components to be used by all components to hibernate. the model attribut of a scenario is of type Model interface and each component implements a model:Model to delegate to the scenar component for hibernation. if a component references another component, the scenario will serialize an IOR to hibernate and reliad the component. 
dilligent plan the migration in a pdca. ask wuestions and then start the planned migration pdca by pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Acknowledged comprehensive architecture requirements! Planning systematic migration with clarifying questions about DefaultIOR location, 5-layer structure, version progression, and Model interface standardization before beginning PDCA-by-PDCA implementation.

**Learning Applied:** Complex architectural migrations require thorough questioning and planning to ensure all interdependent systems align correctly with Web4 standards.

## **üìã PLAN**

**Objective:** Plan systematic ONCE migration to Web4 standards with proper questions and phased PDCA implementation

**Requirements Traceability:** TRON detailed architecture specifications for IOR standardization, 5-layer pattern, version staging, testing, and scenario component delegation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Architecture Questions:** Clarify implementation details before coding
- **Phased Migration Planning:** Break complex migration into manageable PDCA cycles
- **Standards Alignment:** Ensure all components follow unified Web4 patterns
- **Testing Strategy:** Define scope before implementation to ensure stability

## **üîß DO**

**Migration Planning Questions - ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION NEEDED**

### **üîç Critical Architecture Questions:**

#### **1. DefaultIOR Implementation Questions:**
- **Q1.1:** Should I use the existing DefaultIOR from components/Scenario/0.1.3.0/src/ts/layer2/ or create a new implementation?
- **Q1.2:** The current Scenario component has IOR handling - should ONCE extend this or implement independently?
- **Q1.3:** You mentioned "rascally" - should this be a robust/resilient implementation pattern or did you mean "radically"?

#### **2. 5-Layer Architecture Questions:**
- **Q2.1:** Which 5-layer pattern should ONCE follow - TSRanger's CLI/Controller/Interface/Implementation/Infrastructure or a different structure?
- **Q2.2:** Should ONCE layers integrate with existing Scenario component layers or be completely independent?
- **Q2.3:** How should the Object Network Communication Engine map across the 5 layers (which layer handles P2P, which handles server lifecycle)?

#### **3. Version Progression Questions:**
- **Q3.1:** What specific functionality should be delivered in each version milestone (0.3.0.0, 0.3.0.1, etc.) leading to 0.3.1.0?
- **Q3.2:** Should each version be production-ready or can intermediate versions be development/testing builds?
- **Q3.3:** What triggers moving from one version to the next (feature completion, test coverage, stability metrics)?

#### **4. Testing Scope Definition Questions:**
- **Q4.1:** What ONCE features are most critical to test for stability (scenario hibernation, P2P communication, server lifecycle)?
- **Q4.2:** Should tests focus on backward compatibility with 0.2.0.0 scenarios or only validate 0.3.x.x functionality?
- **Q4.3:** Do you want integration tests with other components or unit tests for ONCE functionality only?
- **Q4.4:** What performance benchmarks should be maintained (startup time, memory usage, scenario processing speed)?

#### **5. Scenario Component Architecture Questions:**
- **Q5.1:** Should the Scenario component be enhanced to support Model interface delegation or create a new ScenarioManager component?
- **Q5.2:** How should components discover and use the Scenario component for hibernation (import, IOR reference, dependency injection)?
- **Q5.3:** Should the Model interface be generic (Model\<T>) or component-specific (ONCEModel, UnitModel, etc.)?
- **Q5.4:** For IOR serialization: should component references be stored as IOR strings, IOR objects, or both with transformation methods?

#### **6. Implementation Priority Questions:**
- **Q6.1:** What should be the first PDCA cycle - IOR standardization, 5-layer structure, or scenario integration?
- **Q6.2:** Should I start with ONCE 0.3.0.0 implementation or first create the unified Model interface pattern?
- **Q6.3:** Do you want to see the migration plan broken down by specific PDCAs before starting implementation?

### **üéØ Proposed PDCA Migration Sequence:**
```
PDCA 1: IOR & DefaultIOR Standardization
PDCA 2: 5-Layer Architecture Implementation  
PDCA 3: Model Interface & Scenario Integration
PDCA 4: Version 0.3.0.0 Core Implementation
PDCA 5: Vitest Test Suite (scope to be defined)
PDCA 6: Version progression to 0.3.1.0
PDCA 7: Component ecosystem integration
```
