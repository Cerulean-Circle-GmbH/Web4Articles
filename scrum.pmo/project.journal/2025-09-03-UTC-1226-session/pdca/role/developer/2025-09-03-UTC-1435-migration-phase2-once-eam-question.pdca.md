### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **ONCE EAM Layer Assignment** - Selected: Follow IOR component pattern (options a/b/c are equivalent, just different naming) - use established radical OOP patterns for all future migration

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-03-UTC-1435)**
```quote
Phase 1 refinements implemented following radical OOP patterns.
Ready for Phase 2 - ONCE component EAM layer assignment.

QUESTION: How should ONCE Object Network Communication Engine features be distributed across Web4 EAM layers 1-5?

 options a,b, c seem to be equivalent just different namings. keep the patters from ior and model for all future migration 
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect insight! You're absolutely right - the EAM layer options were equivalent with different naming. Standardizing on IOR and Model patterns for all future migration work. This establishes consistent architectural foundation across entire Web4 component ecosystem.

**Learning Applied:** Pattern standardization eliminates architectural confusion and enables systematic component migration using unified radical OOP approach.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Define ONCE component Web4 EAM layer architecture before implementing 0.3.0.0

**Requirements Traceability:** Phase 2 of ONCE migration requiring Web4 EAM semantic layer assignment for Object Network Communication Engine features

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Feature Analysis:** Map current ONCE capabilities to appropriate EAM layers
- **Semantic Assignment:** Ensure each layer has coherent semantic responsibility
- **Architecture Clarity:** Clear separation of concerns across 5 layers
- **Implementation Readiness:** Prepare for ONCE 0.3.0.0 creation with proper layer structure

---

## **🔧 DO**

**ONCE Feature Mapping Analysis**

**1. Current ONCE Features Inventory**
```typescript
// From ONCE 0.1.0.0 + 0.2.0.0 analysis:

SERVER LIFECYCLE:
- startComponent() / stopComponent() / pauseComponent() / resumeComponent()
- Component registry and lifecycle hooks
- Process management (PID tracking, auto-restart)
- Server hierarchy coordination (primary/secondary)

P2P COMMUNICATION:
- WebRTC peer discovery and connection
- Scenario exchange between ONCE kernels  
- Distributed object network with routing
- Peer connection management

PLATFORM DETECTION:
- Environment detection (Node.js, Browser, Worker, PWA, iframe)
- Platform-specific capability adaptation
- Performance optimization per platform
- < 100ms initialization, < 5MB footprint

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Default port 42777 management
- HTTP/HTTPS server capabilities
- WebSocket server functionality
- Network location and endpoint management

INTERACTIVE INTERFACE:
- CLI commands (info, env, metrics, start, discover, connect)
- Interactive demos and examples
- Developer experience tools
- Component inspection and debugging
```

**2. Web4 EAM Semantic Layer Options**
```
OPTION A: Protocol-Focused Assignment
Layer1: Network protocols + Platform detection
Layer2: DefaultONCE + Server lifecycle  
Layer3: ONCE interface contracts
Layer4: Component orchestration + P2P coordination
Layer5: CLI + Interactive demos

OPTION B: Infrastructure-Focused Assignment  
Layer1: Infrastructure (ports/sockets/processes)
Layer2: Core engine implementation
Layer3: ONCE API contracts
Layer4: Business workflow coordination  
Layer5: User experience + demos

OPTION C: Communication-Focused Assignment
Layer1: Transport protocols + environment
Layer2: Object Network Communication engine
Layer3: Component interfaces
Layer4: Distributed system orchestration
Layer5: Developer tools + management
```

**3. Phase 1 Foundation Integration**
```typescript
// Shared IOR component ready for ONCE integration:
components/IOR/0.3.0.0/
├── src/ts/layer3/IOR.interface.ts    # IOR + Model interfaces + exports
├── src/ts/layer3/Model.interface.ts  # Unified Model interface
├── src/ts/layer2/DefaultIOR.ts       # Radical OOP proxy implementation
└── src/ts/layer2/DefaultModel.ts     # Radical OOP proxy implementation

// ONCE 0.3.0.0 will import and use these foundations
```
