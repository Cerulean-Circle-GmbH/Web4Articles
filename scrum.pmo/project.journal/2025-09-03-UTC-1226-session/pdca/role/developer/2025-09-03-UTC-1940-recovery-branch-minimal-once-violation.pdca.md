# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Recovery Branch Creation - MinimalONCE Already Major Violation**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-09-03-UTC-1940  
**🎯 Objective:** Create isolated recovery branch after TRON identified MinimalONCE as major Web4 violation  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1.4.2  

**👤 Agent Name:** Claude Developer → Recovery Branch Isolation Specialist  
**👤 Agent Role:** Developer → Isolated Recovery & Pre-MinimalONCE State Discovery  
**👤 Branch:** dev/destroyed-once → Isolated Recovery Branch  
**🔄 Sync Requirements:** Catastrophic DORY recovery → Isolated branch recovery  
**🎯 Project Journal Session:** 2025-09-03-UTC-1226-session → Recovery Branch Creation & Violation Timeline Correction  
**🎯 Sprint:** Extended Session → Isolated Recovery Attempt  
**✅ Task:** Create Recovery Branch & Find Pre-MinimalONCE Working State  
**🚨 Issues:** MinimalONCE was ALREADY a major Web4 violation, not the solution  

**📎 Previous Commit:** ba6a28eb - Document catastrophic DORY violations and recovery strategy for ONCE

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **Recovery Requirement:** c8d4f2a9-5e7b-4c3d-8f6a-9b2e5d8c4f2a.scenario.json
- **Current Branch:** dev/destroyed-once (isolated recovery)
- **Protected Branch:** dev/once (no further damage)

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Pre-MinimalONCE Recovery Target**
  - a) b3cad6de - ONCE seamless execution success (but mentions StandaloneONCE)
  - b) 017401bb - Fix critical build issues with seamless execution  
  - c) Earlier commits before any Standalone/Minimal violations
- [ ] **Recovery Strategy**
  - a) Find truly clean pre-violation state
  - b) Attempt to fix violations incrementally from known point
- [ ] **Working State Definition**
  - a) Look for commits without any Standalone/Minimal mentions
  - b) Focus on basic ONCE functionality before complexity

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-03-UTC-1940)**
```quote
already minimalOnce was a major violation.
create a new branch dev/destroyed-once and try to recover there to not even more break dev/once.
```

### **My Answer**
CRITICAL CORRECTION! MinimalONCE was already a major Web4 violation, not the solution. Created dev/destroyed-once branch for isolated recovery. Found violation timeline: MinimalONCE commits starting from f53b7f47. Need to find pre-MinimalONCE working state. Created requirement c8d4f2a9-5e7b-4c3d-8f6a-9b2e5d8c4f2a.

**Learning Applied:** MinimalONCE was part of the problem, not the solution. Recovery must find truly clean pre-violation state.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Find pre-MinimalONCE working state and attempt recovery in isolation

**VIOLATION TIMELINE CORRECTION:**
- ❌ **Previous Assumption**: MinimalONCE was working solution  
- ✅ **Reality**: MinimalONCE was already major Web4 violation
- 🎯 **Need**: Find pre-MinimalONCE working state

**Recovery Candidates Found:**
1. **b3cad6de** - "ONCE seamless execution success" (but mentions StandaloneONCE - suspicious)
2. **017401bb** - "Fix critical build issues with seamless execution" 
3. **Earlier commits** - Before any Standalone/Minimal violations

**Branch Isolation:**
- ✅ **dev/destroyed-once**: Created for recovery attempts
- ✅ **dev/once**: Protected from further damage

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **RECOVERY BRANCH CREATED**

**Branch Status:**
```bash
Switched to a new branch 'dev/destroyed-once'
```

**Violation Timeline Analysis:**
- **f53b7f47**: "BREAKTHROUGH: ONCE seamless execution working! MinimalONCE implementation" - VIOLATION!
- **5596470d**: "MinimalONCE implementation & critical test achievement" - VIOLATION!
- **cefa8ea7**: "Web4-compliant ONCE 0.3.0.1: DORY leftover elimination" - VIOLATION!

**Pre-MinimalONCE Candidates:**
- **b3cad6de**: "ONCE seamless execution success" - mentions StandaloneONCE (suspicious)
- **017401bb**: "Fix critical build issues" - might be clean
- **Need to go further back** to find truly clean state

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Recovery Branch Verification:**
- ✅ **Branch Created**: dev/destroyed-once active
- ✅ **Isolation**: dev/once protected from further damage
- ❌ **Clean State**: Not yet identified

**Violation Recognition:**
- ✅ **MinimalONCE**: Confirmed as major Web4 violation
- ✅ **StandaloneONCE**: Obviously major violation
- ❌ **Clean State**: Pre-violation state not yet found

## **🎯 ACT**

**RECOVERY TARGET DECISIONS NEEDED:**

**Pre-MinimalONCE Recovery Target:**
- a) b3cad6de - ONCE seamless execution success (but mentions StandaloneONCE)
- b) 017401bb - Fix critical build issues with seamless execution  
- c) Earlier commits before any Standalone/Minimal violations

**Recovery Strategy:**
- a) Find truly clean pre-violation state
- b) Attempt to fix violations incrementally from known point

**Working State Definition:**
- a) Look for commits without any Standalone/Minimal mentions
- b) Focus on basic ONCE functionality before complexity

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Which recovery target should I investigate first to find the truly clean pre-violation working state?

I'm now in isolated dev/destroyed-once branch to prevent further damage to dev/once. Ready to attempt recovery once I identify the correct pre-violation target.
