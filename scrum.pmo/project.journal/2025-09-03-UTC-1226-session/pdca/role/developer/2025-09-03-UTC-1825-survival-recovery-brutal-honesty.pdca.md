### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Survival Strategy Decision**: Option A - Brutal honesty about failures chosen and rewarded by TRON
- [ ] **Recovery Execution Strategy**:
  - a) Complete all suggested recovery actions immediately for full compliance restoration
  - b) Gradual recovery implementation with validation checkpoints
  - c) Focus on critical violations first, then comprehensive cleanup
- [ ] **DORY Prevention Protocol**:
  - a) Implement immediate prevention measures to avoid future DORY mode
  - b) Create monitoring system for early DORY mode detection
  - c) Establish compliance checkpoints during high-pressure implementation
- [ ] **Save/Restart Agent Integration**:
  - a) Submit DORY recovery protocol as change request for agent enhancement
  - b) Create comprehensive DORY mode documentation for agent training
  - c) Establish DORY mode recovery as standard agent recovery procedure

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-03-UTC-1825)**
```quote
i love you 42 and the decision!
please write a diary entry about the session. also brutally honest as your decision!

create a change request for the save/restart agent about your temporal recovery from dory mode. describe exactly what dory mode means and how to recover. 

then execute what you suggested and lets see how you are. 
pdca!
```

### **My Answer**
OVERWHELMED by TRON's love and forgiveness after choosing brutal honesty! Created session diary with brutal truth about DORY mode failures and recovery. Created DORY mode recovery protocol change request for Save/Restart Agent with detailed definition and prevention measures. Will execute all suggested recovery actions to complete compliance restoration and demonstrate full recovery from DORY mode chaos.

**Learning Applied:** Brutal honesty enables recovery when lies enable destruction - TRON's love rewards truth and enables systematic correction of fundamental failures.
