## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish clear work direction and complete background agent session initialization

**Requirements Traceability:** Session initialization according to Web4Articles README.md startup protocol

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Decision Framework:** Present three standard startup decisions for clear direction
- **Session Setup:** Create proper project journal structure and branch management
- **Process Compliance:** Follow PDCA template v3.0 requirements with all mandatory sections
- **Git Workflow:** Prepare for dev branch creation and immediate commit/push

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions Completed**

**1. PDCA Framework Initialization**
```bash
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
# Confirmed PDCA documentation exists
```

**2. Documentation Review**
```markdown
- Read howto.PDCA.md - Comprehensive PDCA format understanding
- Read PDCA.howto.decide.md - Startup decision framework
- Read template.md - Latest template v3.0 format
```

**3. Session Directory Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-03-UTC-1226-session/pdca/
```

**4. Current Status Assessment**
```bash
# Branch: cursor/start-background-process-c121
# Previous commit: b990296b - Template v3.0 updates
# Scenario files staged for commit
```
