## Project status (ScrumMaster)
- **Role**: ScrumMaster (autonomous), coordinating all roles and enforcing project principles
- **Branch**: [cursor/recovery-2025-08-12-1102](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/cursor/recovery-2025-08-12-1102)

## Environment
- Docker: Not installed (command not found)
- Node: v22.16.0; npm 10.9.2
- PlantUML/Graphviz: Not installed
- Devcontainer: Pending completion of sprint-4 (all tasks unchecked)

## Tests
- Not executed during recovery
- Action: Run full suite after recovery to verify [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)

## Branching and CI/CD
- Primary branches: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) (prod), [release/production](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/production) (mirror), [release/testing](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/testing), [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- Automation: Planned in sprint 9; partial implementation exists
- Status:
  - Recovery branch created from latest release/dev
  - Previous recovery (2025-08-12-1039) indicates 8 pending merges with conflicts from sprint 9
- Recommendations:
  - Prioritize resolution of remaining sprint 9 merge conflicts
  - Complete sprint 4 devcontainer setup for standardized environment

## Sprints Overview
- Existing: [sprint-0](../../sprints/sprint-0/planning.md), [sprint-1](../../sprints/sprint-1/planning.md), [sprint-2](../../sprints/sprint-2/planning.md), [sprint-3](../../sprints/sprint-3/planning.md), [sprint-4](../../sprints/sprint-4/planning.md) on [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main)
- Discovered/Merged: [sprint-5](../../sprints/sprint-5/planning.md), [sprint-6](../../sprints/sprint-6/planning.md) (TSRanger v2), [sprint-8](../../sprints/sprint-8/planning.md) (Ranger analysis), [sprint-9](../../sprints/sprint-9/planning.md) (CI/CD pipeline)
- Missing: sprint-7
- Created: none during recovery
- Upcoming: [sprint-10](../../sprints/sprint-10/plan.md) (AI-GPL license enforcement with LicenseTool)

## Recent Activity
- Recovery process executed from release/dev
- Previous recovery at 2025-08-12-1039 completed sprint 9 integration work
- See [qa-feedback-log.md](../../qa-feedback-log.md)
- See [recovery.md](../../recovery.md)

## Risks/Blockers
- Docker not available in current environment (prefer using updown-dev-container [[memory:5469213]])
- PlantUML/Graphviz missing (required for architecture diagrams)
- Sprint 9 merge conflicts still pending resolution
- Node version mismatch warnings may occur (v22.16.0 vs project requirements)

## Next Steps
- Run full test suite on release/dev to verify current state
- Set up development environment using updown-dev-container [[memory:5469213]]
- Begin Sprint 10 implementation of AI-GPL license tooling
- Resolve remaining sprint 9 merge conflicts
- Export chat history to CeruleanCircle/AI.Agent.setup/chat_history.md [[memory:5453222]]
