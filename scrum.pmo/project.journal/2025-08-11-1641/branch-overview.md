- **Special Purpose Branches:** 3

## Notes

- **EOD Status:** This is an end-of-day merge documentation capturing branch states
- Branches prefixed with `cursor/` appear to be AI-generated feature branches
- Branches prefixed with `chore/` contain maintenance work
- Branches prefixed with `feat/` contain feature implementations
- The `handover/` prefix indicates knowledge transfer branches
- The `test/` prefix indicates experimental or testing branches
- **Release Branch:** origin/release/dev last merged at 2025-08-11 (multiple branch integrations)

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Review:** Sprint 4 related branches (`chore/sprint-4-devcontainer`, `feat/sprint-4-devcontainer-planning-pr`) should be reviewed for alignment
2. **Cleanup Candidates:** Already merged branches can be deleted after verification
3. **Active Work:** Multiple TSRanger-related branches suggest ongoing development in that area
