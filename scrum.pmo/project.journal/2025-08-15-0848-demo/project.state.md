## Project status (CI/CD Agent - Demonstration)
- **Role**: CI/CD Agent (demonstration), showcasing enhanced recovery system with tree indexing
- **Branch**: [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate tree.index.md generation and role-flexible recovery

## Environment
- Docker: Docker version 28.3.2, build 578ccf6
- Node: v20.4.0; npm 9.7.2
- PlantUML/Graphviz: Available
- Devcontainer: Available

## Tests
- Enhanced recovery system: ✅ Implemented
- CI/CD safety protocols: ✅ Active
- Action: Run full suite after merges to verify [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) and [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)

## Branching and CI/CD
- Primary branches: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) (prod), [release/production](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/production) (mirror), [release/testing](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/testing), [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- Automation: CI/CD Agent safety protocols active, automated release scripts implemented
- Status:
  - ✅ Enhanced recovery system with role flexibility implemented
  - ✅ Critical branch safety protocols established (see [CI/CD Agent PDCA](../../../roles/CICDAgent/PDCA/2025-08-15-UTC-0824.md))
- Recommendations:
  - Use automated release scripts for all branch operations
  - Maintain multi-agent coordination protocols

## Sprints Overview
- Active: Sprint 18 (comprehensive project structure) on [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- Links: [sprint-18 planning](../../sprints/sprint-18/planning.md), [sprint-17 preview](../../sprints/sprint-17/planning-preview.md)
- Components: [GitScrumProject](../../Documentation/GitScrumProject/), [TSRanger](../../components/TSRanger/)
- Recent: Enhanced with versioned component structure and CI/CD safety protocols

## Enhanced Features Demonstrated
- ✅ Role-flexible recovery (CI/CD Agent demonstration)
- ✅ Automatic tree.index.md generation ([view tree index](./tree.index.md))
- ✅ Enhanced project index with GitHub links
- ✅ Symbolic link analysis and directory indexing
- ✅ Branch safety protocols and multi-agent coordination

## Recent Activity
- See [CI/CD Agent process](../../roles/CICDAgent/process.md) - NEW: Branch safety protocols
- QA log updates: [qa-feedback-log.md](../../qa-feedback-log.md)
- Recovery log: [recovery.md](../../recovery.md)
- Critical incident: [CI/CD Agent PDCA](../../roles/CICDAgent/PDCA/2025-08-15-UTC-0824.md)

## Risks/Blockers
- ✅ RESOLVED: Branch switching safety during multi-agent operations
- ✅ MITIGATED: Manual release operations replaced with automated scripts

## Next Steps
- Continue development in release/dev branch with enhanced safety protocols
- Test automated release scripts in controlled environment
- Expand CI/CD Agent role with additional automation capabilities
- Regular safety protocol reviews and improvements

## Demonstration Notes
This project state demonstrates the enhanced recovery system with:
- Role-flexible recovery (recovered as CI/CD Agent)
- Automatic tree.index.md generation
- Enhanced GitHub link integration
- Critical safety protocol enforcement
