### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1300)**
```quote
switch to dev/destroyed-once
```

### **My Answer**
Successfully switched to dev/destroyed-once branch as requested. The branch exists remotely and has been checked out locally. I can see this branch has recent commits related to learning summary and requirements analysis with Sprint 20 integration. Ready to analyze the branch state and continue development work in this context.

**Learning Applied:** Branch switching maintains development continuity while adapting to different development contexts and branch-specific priorities.

## **üìã PLAN**

**Objective:** Successfully transition development context to dev/destroyed-once branch and establish continued technical development workflow

**Requirements Traceability:** User branch switch request, maintain Developer role focus, continue multi-day technical development session

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Branch Verification:** Confirm successful switch to dev/destroyed-once with proper tracking setup
- **State Analysis:** Examine branch-specific components, recent commits, and development context
- **Development Continuity:** Maintain technical development focus while adapting to branch-specific priorities
- **Session Integration:** Establish proper PDCA documentation and session management on new branch

## **üîß DO**

**Branch Switch Implementation**

**1. Branch Existence Check**
```bash
# Verified dev/destroyed-once exists remotely
git branch -a | grep destroyed-once
# Found: remotes/origin/dev/destroyed-once
```

**2. Branch Switch Execution**
```bash
# Successfully switched to dev/destroyed-once branch
git checkout dev/destroyed-once
# Result: branch 'dev/destroyed-once' set up to track 'origin/dev/destroyed-once'
# Status: Switched to a new branch 'dev/destroyed-once'
```

**3. Branch State Analysis**
```bash
# Analyzed recent commits
git log --oneline -3
# Latest: 48b8b746 Learning Summary SUCCESS: Comprehensive requirements analysis with Sprint 20 integration
# Previous: ad33983a Add DORY symptom recognition and PDCA compliance protocol requirement
# Earlier: e956bd0c Table Format Progress: Fixed key entries with actual decision structure
```

**4. Directory Structure Assessment**
```bash
# Confirmed workspace structure
pwd && ls -la
# Location: /workspace
# Key directories: components/, src/, scrum.pmo/, test/, scenarios/
# Source structure: src/ts/scenarios/ available for development
```
