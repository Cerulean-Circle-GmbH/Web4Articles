you seem to have no glue what you do. clean it all up. each component builds with npm run build
into a dist folder

# Where definition.txt contains: "M2 Class for M1 file instances"
echo "M2 Class for M1 file instances" > definition.txt

this is total bullshit.

the command should be
unit create <name> <definition>

as it was used and immediately store the definition correctly.

see the ontology table from the ontology agent. what would we need to improve to let the agent create units from each entry.

eg.
name can contain multiple words separated by spaces. filename should not have spaces, but „.." instead.

btw. do not do these ontological enhancements. and NEVER use —options in web4 clis EVER. make this a global requirement with requirement v0.1.2.2. unix and shells where meant to be OOP but the introduction of options killed it all.
