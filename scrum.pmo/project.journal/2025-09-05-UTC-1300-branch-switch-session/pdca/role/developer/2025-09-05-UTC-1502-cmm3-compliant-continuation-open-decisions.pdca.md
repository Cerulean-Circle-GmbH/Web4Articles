- **Previous Open Decisions Analysis:** Multiple PDCAs with pending decisions requiring resolution

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: User selected Decision 1a - strict minimal chat format as described in howto PDCA
- [x] Completed decision: Analyzed howto PDCA communication protocol - sufficiently clear, no improvements needed
- [x] Completed decision: Gathered all previous open decisions from session PDCAs
- [ ] **Decision 1: Branch Development Context (from 2025-09-05-UTC-1300)**
  - a) Analyze destroyed-once branch specific components and recent development history
  - b) Continue previous technical development priorities from 2025-09-05-UTC-1149 session
  - c) Focus on branch-specific features and requirements unique to destroyed-once context
  - d) Integrate branch state with multi-day technical development session planning

- [ ] **Decision 2: Git Workflow Automation Level (from 2025-09-05-UTC-1303)**
  - a) Manual git pull after each commit with explicit verification and conflict resolution
  - b) Semi-automated workflow with git aliases for commit-pull-push sequences
  - c) Full automation with git hooks for post-commit pull operations
  - d) Conditional pull based on remote changes detection before each operation

- [ ] **Decision 3: ONCE Version Validation Strategy (from 2025-09-05-UTC-1306)**
  - a) Test ONCE v0.3.0.2 functionality immediately after linking to verify operational status
  - b) Document version change and create rollback procedure in case of issues
  - c) Update related components that may depend on ONCE version compatibility
  - d) Create comprehensive version management documentation for future upgrades

- [ ] **Decision 4: ONCE Deinstall Implementation Approach (from 2025-09-05-UTC-1357)**
  - a) Add deinstall method to DefaultONCE.ts following build version pattern with comprehensive ecosystem cleaning
  - b) Update ONCECLI.ts to include deinstall command in usage display and ensure CLI delegation works
  - c) Remove bash deinstall function from shell script and rely entirely on TypeScript implementation
  - d) Add cleanAllComponents helper method to support proper component ecosystem cleaning

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1502)**
```quote
1a as described in the howto pdca. improve the howto pdca if it was not clear enough.
now give me the previous open decisions then continue cmm3 compliant.
```

### **My Answer**
Implementing Decision 1a strict minimal chat format. Reviewed howto PDCA communication protocol (lines 229-237) - it's sufficiently clear with explicit instructions: "Dual-format links and NUMBERED decisions ONLY", "NO summaries or explanations in chat - just links and decisions!". Gathered 4 categories of previous open decisions from session PDCAs. Ready to continue CMM3 compliant development with proper decision resolution process.

**Learning Applied:** CMM3 compliance requires systematic resolution of open decisions and adherence to established communication protocols for process maturity.

## **üìã PLAN**

**Objective:** Implement strict minimal chat format, resolve previous open decisions systematically, and continue CMM3 compliant development process

**Requirements Traceability:** Decision 1a selection, CMM3 process maturity requirements, open decision resolution for systematic development

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Format Implementation:** Apply strict minimal chat format (dual links + QA decisions only) to all future responses
- **Howto PDCA Review:** Assess communication protocol clarity and determine if improvements needed
- **Decision Consolidation:** Gather all previous open decisions from session PDCAs for systematic resolution
- **CMM3 Compliance:** Continue development with proper decision tracking and resolution processes

**Previous Open Decisions Analysis:**
- **Branch Context Decisions:** Development approach and focus area selection
- **Git Workflow Decisions:** Automation level and conflict resolution strategy
- **ONCE Version Decisions:** Validation strategy and compatibility management
- **ONCE Deinstall Decisions:** Implementation approach and component integration
