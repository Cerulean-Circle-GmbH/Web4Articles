### **DEEP UNIT INTENTION ANALYSIS FROM ALL SOURCES**

**1. Unit as Web4 Foundation Pattern (Sprint 20 Planning)**
- **Dual Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/destroyed-once/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/planning.md) | [scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/planning.md](../../../sprints/sprint-20/planning.md)
- **Key Finding:** "Everything Is An Object Principle: Everything is a file, Everything is an object, Everything has a UUID, Objects are instances of classes, Instances have serializable state models, State can be hibernated and restored"

**2. UCP (Unit-Component-Package) Architecture Foundation**
- **Dual Links:** [Session Overview UCP](2025-09-06-UTC-0650-session-overview-analysis-decisions-understanding.pdca.md) | [TRON UCP Quote](../../../sprints/sprint-20/session-overview-analysis.pdca.md)
- **Key Finding:** "UCP stands for Unit-Component-Package… Web4 is all about reusable self managed components wit UCP standard… so DRY"

**3. Unit as Atomic Business Logic Element**
- **Dual Links:** [Unit Implementation Analysis](../../../../components/Unit/0.3.0.2/src/ts/layer2/DefaultUnit.ts) | [Unit Interface Definition](../../../../components/Unit/0.3.0.2/src/ts/layer3/Unit.ts)
- **Key Finding:** Units represent atomic executable business logic operations with evidence-based execution and full traceability
