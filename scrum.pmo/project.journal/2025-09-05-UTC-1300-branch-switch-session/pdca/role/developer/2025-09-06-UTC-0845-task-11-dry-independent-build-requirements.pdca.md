### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Task 11 Requirements:** Highlight DRY and independent build/start/clean requirements
- [x] **Execution Preparation:** Prepare for systematic task-by-task execution
- [ ] **Execution Approach:**
  - a) Begin Task 11 implementation immediately with role-based PDCA
  - b) Create additional task clarification before implementation
- [ ] **Implementation Strategy:**
  - a) Single comprehensive implementation of all Task 11 requirements
  - b) Incremental implementation with validation at each step

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-0845)**
```quote
highlight the task the DRY and that the unit need to independently build start and clean itself. pdca and after that we start to work of task by task in a single new pdca in the corresponding role, always with decisions for me and web4 principles fulfilled.
```

### **My Answer**
Highlighting Task 11 DRY requirements and Unit's independent build/start/clean capability needs. After this PDCA, will begin systematic task-by-task execution with role-based PDCAs, always presenting decisions and ensuring Web4 principles are fulfilled throughout implementation.

**Learning Applied:** Clear task requirements and systematic execution approach ensures Web4 compliance and proper decision-making throughout implementation.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Clarify Task 11 DRY and independent build requirements, then prepare for systematic task execution

**Requirements Traceability:** Task 11 clarity → Systematic task-by-task execution

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Task 11 DRY Highlighting:** Emphasize DRY principle requirements
- **Independent Build Requirements:** Define Unit's self-contained build/start/clean needs
- **Execution Preparation:** Prepare for role-based task execution with decisions
- **Web4 Compliance:** Ensure all principles fulfilled throughout process

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Task 11 Requirements Clarification and Execution Preparation**

**1. Task 11 DRY Requirements Highlighting**
Emphasizing DRY principle compliance in Unit implementation.

**2. Independent Build/Start/Clean Requirements**
Defining Unit's self-contained operational requirements.

**3. Systematic Execution Preparation**
Preparing for role-based task-by-task execution approach.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Task 11 Requirements Clarification (✅ COMPLETE)**

### **TASK 11 DRY REQUIREMENTS HIGHLIGHTED**

**Critical DRY Compliance Requirements:**
- **No Code Duplication:** Unit must eliminate all duplicate interface definitions
- **Single Source of Truth:** Unit interfaces must be the authoritative source for all components
- **Shared Pattern Usage:** Unit must use established patterns (User 0.3.0.4, UnitIndexStorage)
- **No Redundant Implementations:** Single DefaultUnit implementation, no duplicates
- **Reusable Components:** Unit patterns must be reusable by all other components

### **UNIT INDEPENDENT BUILD/START/CLEAN REQUIREMENTS**

**Self-Contained Operation Requirements:**
- **Independent Build:** `cd components/Unit/0.3.0.4 && npm run build` must work without external dependencies
- **Independent Start:** Unit CLI must start and show usage without manual setup
- **Independent Clean:** `npm run clean` must reset all build files for clean testing
- **No External Dependencies:** Unit must build without requiring other components to be built first
- **Self-Bootstrapping:** Unit must be able to initialize from existing scenarios/index/ storage independently

**Web4 Compliance Requirements:**
- **Empty Constructor:** No dependencies or configuration in constructor
- **Scenario Initialization:** Init from standard Web4 scenario format
- **UnitIndexStorage Integration:** Use existing storage system for LD links
- **Speaking Name Resolution:** Enable human-readable names mapping to UUIDs
- **Standard Interface Pattern:** Follow User 0.3.0.4 template for interface separation

### **SYSTEMATIC EXECUTION PREPARATION**

**Role-Based Task Execution Approach:**
- **Single PDCA per Task:** Each task gets dedicated role-based PDCA
- **Decision Presentation:** Always present options for TRON decision-making
- **Web4 Principle Fulfillment:** Ensure all principles followed throughout
- **Incremental Validation:** Validate each step maintains Web4 compliance

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Task Requirements:** DRY and independent operation requirements must be clearly defined
- ✅ **Execution Approach:** Role-based task execution with decisions and Web4 compliance
