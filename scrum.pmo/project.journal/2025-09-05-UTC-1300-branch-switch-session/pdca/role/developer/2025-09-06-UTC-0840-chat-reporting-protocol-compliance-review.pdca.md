### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Compliance Review:** Re-read chat reporting protocol requirements
- [x] **DORY Prevention:** Understand communication standards to prevent violations
- [ ] **All clear, no decisions to make** - Chat protocol compliance review conducted

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-0840)**
```quote
refresh your mind about pdca reporting. dory is around the corner.
```

### **My Answer**
Re-reading PDCA howto communication protocol to refresh understanding of proper chat reporting standards. DORY mode prevention requires strict adherence to "detailed content in PDCA files, dual links and decisions only in chat" protocol.

**Learning Applied:** Proper chat reporting protocol prevents DORY mode violations and maintains communication excellence.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Refresh understanding of chat reporting protocol and prevent DORY mode violations

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA communication standards → DORY prevention

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Protocol Review:** Re-read howto.PDCA.md communication requirements
- **Standards Refresh:** Understand proper chat vs PDCA content separation
- **DORY Prevention:** Identify patterns that lead to DORY mode violations
- **Compliance Commitment:** Ensure future responses follow protocol exactly

From howto.PDCA.md Communication Protocol section:

**2. Critical Chat Reporting Standards**
Understanding what must be in chat vs PDCA files:

**3. DORY Mode Prevention Patterns**

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Chat Reporting Protocol Compliance (✅ COMPLETE)**

### **CRITICAL COMMUNICATION STANDARDS REFRESHED**

**What MUST be in Chat:**
- **Dual Links Only:** [GitHub](URL) | [path](path) format exactly
- **QA Decisions Only:** Copy EXACTLY from PDCA Summary section
- **NO summaries or explanations** - just links and decisions
- **NUMBERED decisions** with a) b) options for easy user response

**What MUST NOT be in Chat:**
- ❌ **Detailed content** - goes in PDCA files
- ❌ **Summaries or explanations** - detailed analysis in PDCA
- ❌ **Different QA decisions** - must match PDCA exactly
- ❌ **Long descriptions** - brief links and decisions only

**TRON's Explicit Instruction:**
> **"Much in files, relevant links in chat"**

### **DORY PREVENTION UNDERSTANDING**

**DORY Mode Communication Violations:**
- **Verbose Chat Responses:** Putting detailed analysis in chat instead of PDCA
- **Missing Dual Links:** Not providing proper navigation links
- **Decision Mismatch:** Creating different decisions in chat vs PDCA
- **Summary Creation:** Explaining instead of linking to detailed PDCA content

**Proper Communication Pattern:**
1. **Create PDCA** with detailed analysis, findings, and decisions
2. **Chat Response:** Dual links to PDCA + exact QA decisions copy-paste
3. **No Elaboration:** Let PDCA contain all detail, chat provides navigation

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"refresh your mind about pdca reporting. dory is around the corner."**

**Communication Standards Verified**
- ✅ **Protocol Refreshed:** Chat reporting standards understood and committed
- ✅ **DORY Prevention:** Communication violations identified and avoided
- ✅ **Compliance Commitment:** Future responses will follow protocol exactly
