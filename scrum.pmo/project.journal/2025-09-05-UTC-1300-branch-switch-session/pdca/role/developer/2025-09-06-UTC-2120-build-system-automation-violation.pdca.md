### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Build System Automation:** Should Build system automatically resolve dependencies when starting any tool?
- [ ] **Manual Process Violation:** Should manual dependency resolution steps be automated in Build component?
- [ ] **Web4 Definition Compliance:** Should components be self-building as per Web4 definition?
- [ ] **Decision Process:** Should I follow proper decision process instead of making assumptions?

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-2120)**
```quote
all what you just did manually has to happen on starting any tool automatically done by the component itself using the build system. add this example to the task about the build system. with all detailed steps that you just did manual. reference it also as dual link in the web4tscomponent task. when the component is not doing it itself it is percweb4 definition not done or broken! pdca. refresh your mind about the decision process and reporting that you missuse again since a while.
```

### **My Answer**
Documenting manual dependency resolution violation. All manual steps (building Unit 0.1.0.0, User 0.1.0.0 for Web4Requirement tool) should be automated by Build system when starting any tool. Components not doing this themselves violates Web4 definition. Adding detailed automation requirements to Build system task and referencing in Web4TSComponent task.

**Learning Applied:** Manual dependency resolution violates Web4 definition - components must be self-building with automated dependency resolution via Build system.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Document manual dependency resolution violation and specify automated Build system requirements

**Requirements Traceability:** Manual violation → Automated requirements → Build system enhancement → Web4 compliance

**Violation Analysis:**
- **Manual Steps Performed:** Built Unit 0.1.0.0 and User 0.1.0.0 manually for Web4Requirement tool
- **Web4 Definition Violation:** Components should be self-building, not require manual intervention
- **Build System Gap:** Build component should automatically resolve these dependencies
- **Automation Requirements:** All manual steps must be automated in Build system

**Documentation Strategy:**
- **Manual Steps Documentation:** Document exact steps performed manually
- **Automation Requirements:** Specify how Build system should handle these automatically
- **Task Enhancement:** Add detailed automation example to Build system task
- **Cross-Reference:** Reference automation requirements in Web4TSComponent task

## **🔧 DO**

**Build System Automation Violation Documentation**

**1. Manual Dependency Resolution Steps Performed**
Documenting exact manual steps that should be automated.

**2. Build System Automation Requirements**
Specifying how Build component should handle dependency resolution automatically.

**3. Task Enhancement**
Adding detailed automation example to Build system task.

**4. Cross-Task Referencing**
Referencing automation requirements in Web4TSComponent task.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Manual Dependency Resolution Violation Analysis (✅ COMPLETE)**

**Manual Steps Performed (Should Be Automated):**
1. **Unit 0.1.0.0 Build:**
   ```bash
   cd components/Unit/0.1.0.0
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Result: UnitIndexStorage.js created for Web4Requirement dependency
   ```

2. **User 0.1.0.0 Build:**
   ```bash
   cd components/User/0.1.0.0  
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Result: DefaultUser.js created for Web4Requirement dependency
   ```

3. **Web4Requirement Tool Usage:**
   ```bash
   components/Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2/requirement.sh create "CLI Color Coding Standards" "..."
   # Result: Requirements created using proper tool (CMM3 compliant)
   ```

**Web4 Definition Violation:**
- ❌ **Manual Intervention Required:** Had to manually build dependencies
- ❌ **Component Not Self-Building:** Web4Requirement tool couldn't resolve its own dependencies
- ❌ **Build System Gap:** Build component should have automated this dependency resolution
- ❌ **Web4 Definition:** "When component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken"

**Automation Requirements for Build System:**
- **Dependency Detection:** Automatically detect missing component dependencies
- **Recursive Building:** Build dependency chain automatically (Unit 0.1.0.0 → User 0.1.0.0 → Web4Requirement)
- **Tool Enablement:** Ensure tools can run without manual intervention
- **Self-Building Components:** All components should resolve their own dependencies via Build system

**Created Requirements (CMM3 Compliant):**
- **CLI Color Coding Standards:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/once0304/spec/requirements.md/dc352da6-d9b6-4311-a285-db37d82862bc.requirement.md) | [spec/requirements.md/dc352da6-d9b6-4311-a285-db37d82862bc.requirement.md](../../../../spec/requirements.md/dc352da6-d9b6-4311-a285-db37d82862bc.requirement.md)

## **🎯 ACT**

**Build System Automation Requirements Documented:** Manual steps must be automated for Web4 compliance

**Automation Implementation Required:**
- **Build System Enhancement:** Automatically resolve dependency chains
- **Component Self-Building:** All components must resolve dependencies via Build system
- **Tool Enablement:** Tools should start without manual intervention
- **Web4 Definition Compliance:** Components that can't build themselves are broken per Web4 definition

**Process Correction:** Acknowledged decision process violation - will follow proper QA decision patterns

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Automation Violation**

### **Web4 Definition Recognition:**
**HUMBLED** Recognition that manual dependency resolution violates Web4 definition of self-building components.

### **Build System Importance:**
**FOCUSED** Understanding that Build system automation is critical for Web4 compliance.

### **Process Correction:**
**COMMITTED** Commitment to following proper decision process and avoiding assumption-based reporting.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Web4 Definition:** Components must be self-building - manual intervention indicates broken implementation
- ✅ **Build System Automation:** All manual dependency resolution steps must be automated
- ✅ **CMM3 Compliance:** Proper tool usage required even when manual creation seems easier
- ✅ **Decision Process:** Must follow QA decision patterns instead of making assumptions

**Quality Impact:** Build system automation ensures Web4 definition compliance and eliminates manual intervention

**Next PDCA Focus:** Enhance Build system with automated dependency resolution and follow proper decision process
