### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: User wants simple end-to-end `once` functionality: start → auto-build → usage display
- [x] Completed decision: Use Build component for dependency management and build orchestration
- [x] Completed decision: Maintain Web4 principles throughout implementation
- [ ] **Decision 1: Build Orchestration Strategy**
  - a) Use Build component to detect and build all ONCE dependencies automatically in correct order
  - b) Create simplified ONCE version that works without complex dependency chain
  - c) Fix current ONCE 0.3.0.2 by resolving all TypeScript compilation issues systematically
  - d) Use shell script build logic with Build component integration for dependency management

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-2205)**
```quote
what does that mean?
let me say it simple.

i want 
once

to start, build itself in the correct order automatically and finally show its usage. analyze whats hindering it and fix it. do not violate any Web4 principles and ask me if something is not clear. use the build component.
```

### **My Answer**
Clear requirement understood! You want `scripts/once` command to work end-to-end: execute → auto-detect dependencies → build in correct order using Build component → show usage. Current blocker: ONCE 0.3.0.2 has 13 TypeScript compilation errors preventing CLI from working. Need to analyze what's hindering the complete workflow and fix systematically.

**Learning Applied:** End-to-end functionality requires systematic dependency analysis and build orchestration to ensure complete workflow from command execution to usage display.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Make `scripts/once` command work completely: start → auto-build dependencies → show usage, using Build component for orchestration

**Requirements Traceability:** User requirement for simple end-to-end ONCE functionality with Web4 compliance and Build component integration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Current State Analysis:** Identify exactly what's preventing `scripts/once` from working end-to-end
- **Dependency Chain Analysis:** Map ONCE dependency requirements and build order
- **Build Component Integration:** Use Build component for systematic dependency building
- **Web4 Compliance:** Ensure all fixes maintain Web4 architectural principles
- **End-to-End Testing:** Validate complete workflow from command to usage display

**Current Blockers Analysis:**
1. **ONCE Compilation:** 13 TypeScript errors prevent CLI compilation
2. **Dependency Resolution:** Import paths don't match actual component structure
3. **Build Order:** No systematic dependency building in correct order
4. **CLI Integration:** ONCE CLI can't start due to compilation failures

---

## **🔧 DO**

**End-to-End ONCE Functionality Analysis and Implementation**

**1. Current Workflow Analysis**
```bash
# What should happen:
scripts/once → ONCE shell script → Build component auto-build → ONCE CLI → Usage display

# What actually happens:
scripts/once → ONCE shell script → Attempts npm run build → 13 TypeScript errors → FAILURE

# Root cause: ONCE TypeScript compilation fails due to dependency import issues
```

**2. Dependency Chain Analysis**
```typescript
// ONCE 0.3.0.2 requires:
// 1. IOR component (interface + implementation)
// 2. Scenario component (interface + implementation)  
// 3. User component (implementation)
// 4. Build component (for deinstall functionality)
// 5. Server components (optional - HttpServer, WsServer, P2PServer)

// Current issue: Import paths don't match actual component build structure
```

**3. Build Component Integration Strategy**
```typescript
// Use Build component to:
// 1. Detect ONCE dependencies automatically
// 2. Build dependencies in correct order
// 3. Handle dependency resolution systematically
// 4. Provide proper build orchestration

// Build component already has:
// - buildComponent(path) method
// - resolveDependencies(path) method  
// - Dependency-free architecture
```

**4. Web4 Compliant Solution Approach**
```markdown
# Web4 Principles to Maintain:
1. Component Encapsulation - Each component self-contained
2. Interface-First Dependencies - Import interfaces before implementations
3. Layer Separation - Proper layer3 (interface) and layer2 (implementation) separation
4. Dependency-Free Build - Build component maintains no external dependencies
5. CLI Delegation - Shell scripts delegate to TypeScript implementations

# Solution: Use Build component to orchestrate dependency building while maintaining Web4 architecture
```

**5. Implementation Plan**
```bash
# Step 1: Analyze current `scripts/once` workflow
# Step 2: Identify specific dependency build requirements
# Step 3: Use Build component to build dependencies in correct order
# Step 4: Fix remaining import path issues for ONCE compilation
# Step 5: Test end-to-end: scripts/once → auto-build → usage display
# Step 6: Ensure Web4 compliance throughout
```

**6. Immediate Action: Test Current Workflow**
```bash
# Test what happens when running scripts/once:
scripts/once
# Expected: Should show usage or attempt to build and show usage
# Actual: Will analyze and fix based on results
```

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **End-to-End Focus:** User requirements for complete functionality require systematic workflow analysis and implementation  
- ✅ **Build Integration:** Build component provides proper dependency management capabilities for complex component dependencies
- ✅ **Web4 Compliance:** Architectural principles must be maintained while achieving functional requirements

**Quality Impact:** End-to-end ONCE functionality implementation ensures complete user workflow while maintaining Web4 architectural integrity and proper component dependency management

**Next PDCA Focus:** Execute systematic ONCE workflow fix using Build component for dependency management and TypeScript compilation resolution
