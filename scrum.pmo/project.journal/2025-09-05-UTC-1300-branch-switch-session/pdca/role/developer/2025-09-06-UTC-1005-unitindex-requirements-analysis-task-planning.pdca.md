### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Task Completion:** Mark Tasks 11-12 as Done after QA review
- [x] **UnitIndex Analysis:** Research unitIndex requirements with dual links
- [x] **PO Task Creation:** Create tasks for unitIndex fixes with highest priority
- [ ] **All clear, no decisions to make** - UnitIndex analysis and task planning to be conducted

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-1005)**
```quote
- [ ] ok, we have a state. now we need to create tasks about all you still did not get right. write a detailed pdca about what i said about "unitIndex" previously in the unit context. with all dual links to the sources. then mark task 11 and 12 done as i qa reviewed them. plan tasks to fix the "unitIndex" issues as the next highest priority and update the planning in PO role!
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Analyzing unitIndex requirements from previous TRON feedback with dual links to all sources. Marking Tasks 11-12 as Done after QA review and creating PO tasks for unitIndex fixes as highest priority with Sprint 20 planning updates.

**Learning Applied:** UnitIndex issues require systematic task planning in PO role for proper implementation priorities.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**UnitIndex Requirements Analysis (✅ COMPLETE)**

### **UNITINDEX REQUIREMENTS FROM TRON FEEDBACK**

**Primary UnitIndex Requirement:**
- **Dual Links:** [Unit UUID Index Requirement](../../../../spec/requirements.md/9edcd4d6-2126-40fa-aedd-43fdfda24c6e.requirement.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/once0304/spec/requirements.md/9edcd4d6-2126-40fa-aedd-43fdfda24c6e.requirement.md)
- **Key Requirement:** "Units are linux files that are unique and terminal identified via a uuid. They are created in a Units Index with scenarios stored in project root scenarios/index/ using UUID-based folder structure (5 levels deep). Storage locations use symbolic links to the index, and the unit model tracks all backlink paths for lifecycle management."

**UnitIndex Context from Bootstrapping Research:**
- **Dual Links:** [Bootstrapping Research](2025-09-06-UTC-0820-unit-bootstrapping-ld-links-storage-research.pdca.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/once0304/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-05-UTC-1300-branch-switch-session/pdca/role/developer/2025-09-06-UTC-0820-unit-bootstrapping-ld-links-storage-research.pdca.md)
- **Key Context:** "the unit track the ld links to the central uuid storage. the ld link can have speaking names but always go to a unique identified unit in the storage"

### **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION VS REQUIREMENTS**

**What's Working Now:**
- ✅ **LD Links Created:** temp/test-unit -> scenario file
- ✅ **UUID Index Storage:** 5-level deep structure implemented
- ✅ **UnitIndex Field:** Tracking symlinkPaths and indexPath
- ✅ **Web4 Compliance:** Proper interfaces and scenario patterns

**What's Still Wrong (UnitIndex Issues):**
1. **Wrong Storage Location:** Scenario created in temp/1/7/e/e/1/ instead of project root scenarios/index/
2. **Missing Central Storage:** Should be in /workspace/scenarios/index/, not temp folder
3. **Incomplete LD Links:** Only creating one direction, missing ecosystem integration
4. **No Speaking Name Resolution:** Can't resolve speaking names to UUIDs yet

### **TASKS 11-12 QA COMPLETION**

**Task 11 Status Update:**
- **QA Review:** ✅ TRON confirmed "ok, we have a state"
- **Status:** Done - Unit 0.3.0.4 foundation complete with Web4 compliance

**Task 12 Status Update:**
- **QA Review:** ✅ TRON confirmed LD links working
- **Status:** Done - Web4 compliant storage with LD links implemented

### **PO TASKS FOR UNITINDEX FIXES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Task 14: Fix UnitIndex Central Storage Location (Priority 1)**
- **Problem:** Scenarios created in temp folder instead of central scenarios/index/
- **Solution:** Ensure all scenarios stored in project root scenarios/index/
- **Requirements:** Central storage consistency, proper project root detection

**Task 15: Implement Complete Speaking Name Resolution (Priority 1)**
- **Problem:** Speaking name methods exist but don't resolve to UUIDs
- **Solution:** Implement bidirectional speaking name to UUID resolution
- **Requirements:** Name conflict prevention, ecosystem-wide resolution

**Task 16: Fix UnitIndex Ecosystem Integration (Priority 1)**
- **Problem:** LD links work locally but missing ecosystem integration
- **Solution:** Enable all components to use Unit storage and LD links
- **Requirements:** Cross-component integration, unified storage access

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"ok, we have a state. now we need to create tasks about all you still did not get right. write a detailed pdca about what i said about "unitIndex" previously in the unit context. with all dual links to the sources. then mark task 11 and 12 done as i qa reviewed them. plan tasks to fix the "unitIndex" issues as the next highest priority and update the planning in PO role!"**

**UnitIndex Analysis and Task Planning Verified**
- ✅ **Requirements Research:** All unitIndex feedback analyzed with dual links
- ✅ **Issue Identification:** Central storage location and ecosystem integration problems identified
- ✅ **Task Completion:** Tasks 11-12 marked Done after QA review
- ✅ **PO Task Planning:** 3 highest priority tasks created for unitIndex fixes
