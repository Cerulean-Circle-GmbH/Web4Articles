### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Research Scope:** All PDCAs from 0.3.x.x versions for unexecuted phases
- [x] **Task Extraction:** Convert planned phases to Sprint 20 tasks using PM templates
- [x] **Link Validation:** Fix broken links in previous PDCAs
- [ ] **All clear, no decisions to make** - Historical research and task extraction to be conducted

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-0740)**
```quote
now research all the pdcas from 0.3.x.x versions and add tasks the same way from the prev planned phases that never were executed. double check the broken links in your previous pdca and fix them.
```

### **My Answer**
Conducting comprehensive research of all PDCAs from 0.3.x.x versions to identify planned phases that were never executed and convert them to Sprint 20 tasks using PM templates. Will also validate and fix broken links in previous PDCAs to ensure proper traceability and navigation.

**Learning Applied:** Historical PDCA analysis ensures no planned work is lost and all phases are converted to actionable tasks for systematic execution.
