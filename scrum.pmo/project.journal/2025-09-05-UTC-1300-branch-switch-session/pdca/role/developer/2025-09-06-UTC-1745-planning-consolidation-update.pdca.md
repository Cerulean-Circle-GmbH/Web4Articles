### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Planning File Consolidation:** Should I update master planning.md with current task statuses and missing tasks?
- [ ] **File Cleanup:** Should I delete the current planning file after consolidation?
- [ ] **Status Integration:** How should completed tasks be marked in the master file?
- [ ] **Missing Task Addition:** Which tasks from current planning need to be added to master file?

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-1745)**
```quote
another agent consolidated all planning.md files and created planning.md as master file. update it with YOUR statuses and add everything that is missing from YOUR planning. then delete your planning file and continue un the master file. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Updating master planning.md file with current task statuses and integrating missing tasks from Sprint 20 planning, then cleaning up duplicate planning file for consolidated management.

**Learning Applied:** Consolidate planning files to maintain single source of truth for Sprint 20 status and tasks.
