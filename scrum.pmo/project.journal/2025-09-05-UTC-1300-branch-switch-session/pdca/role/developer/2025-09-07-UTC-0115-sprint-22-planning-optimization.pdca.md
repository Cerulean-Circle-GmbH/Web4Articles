### **QA Decisions**
1a. **IOR Focus Correction:** MVP is about IOR object handling, not URL protocols - sources are git files
2b. **Sprint 20 Integration:** Reorder Sprint 20 tasks for immediate needs before Sprint 22
3c. **TaskStateMachine Compatibility:** Remove priority headlines for tool compatibility
4d. **PO Template Optimization:** Apply original PO template structure with developer learnings

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-07-UTC-0115)**
```quote
excellent analyseis. i disagree with the mvp. its not about urls and protocols its about IORs and ior object handling. and the source is currently always files in git from first usecase!
update the planning according to what needs to be done immediately in sprint 20 in the planning by doing a better ordering in the planning. also remove the priority headlines so that the task state tool can be used. optimize the planning to the original po template with the new learnings from you.
```

### **My Answer**
Correcting MVP focus to IOR object handling with git files as source. Reordering Sprint 20 planning for immediate needs, removing priority headlines for TaskStateMachine compatibility, and optimizing to original PO template structure with developer experience learnings integrated.

**Learning Applied:** MVP is IOR object handling foundation, not protocol abstraction - git files are the primary source requiring immediate Sprint 20 task reordering.

## **🔧 DO**

### **IOR Focus Correction**

**TRON Correction Applied:**
- ❌ **Wrong MVP:** URL protocols (file://, git://, http://)
- ✅ **Correct MVP:** IOR object handling with git file sources
- ✅ **Primary Source:** Git files (current Web4Articles repository)
- ✅ **Core Focus:** IOR reference system for scenario.interface.ts and similar files

### **Sprint 20 Planning Reordering**

**Current Sprint 20 Open Tasks (From Previous Analysis):**
- 📋 Task 15.2: Update Requirement Model with Unit References (BLOCKED)
- 📋 Task 19: Unit Advanced CLI Commands (STATUS DISCREPANCY)  
- 📋 Task 22: UnitCLI Migration to DefaultCLI (BLOCKED by Task 21)

**Immediate Sprint 20 Task Reordering:**

**Sprint 20 Foundation Dependencies Added:**
- Task 19: Unit Advanced CLI Commands (Status Discrepancy Resolution Required)
