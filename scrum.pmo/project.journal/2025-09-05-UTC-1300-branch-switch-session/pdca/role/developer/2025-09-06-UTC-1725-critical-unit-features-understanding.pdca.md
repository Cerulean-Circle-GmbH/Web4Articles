### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Critical Features Understanding:** What specific critical features need to be added to Unit before continuing other tasks?
- [ ] **Feature Priority:** Should these critical features be planned with highest priority above current Priority 1 tasks?
- [ ] **Planning Consolidation:** Should we update master planning.md with current statuses and delete local planning file?
- [ ] **Implementation Approval:** After understanding features, should we proceed with highest priority implementation?

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-1725)**
```quote
we need to add critical features to unit before we continue any other task. create pdcas about the understanding of what i tell you as new features and plan them in with highest priority after approval. another agent tried to consolidate all planning into the master planning.md. update it with your statuses and add missing tasks. then delete your planning file and continue on the main file planning.md. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Ready to understand critical Unit features requirements. Will create PDCA for feature understanding, plan with highest priority after approval, consolidate planning into master planning.md, and delete local planning file.

**Learning Applied:** Critical features must be implemented before continuing other tasks - highest priority planning required.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Understand critical Unit features and consolidate planning with highest priority implementation

**Requirements Traceability:** Feature understanding → Highest priority planning → Master planning consolidation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Feature Understanding:** Listen to and analyze critical Unit features requirements
- **Priority Planning:** Plan critical features with highest priority above current tasks
- **Planning Consolidation:** Update master planning.md with current statuses and missing tasks
- **File Cleanup:** Delete local planning file, continue with master planning.md

**Planning Consolidation Tasks:**
- Update master planning.md with current task statuses
- Add missing tasks from local planning
- Ensure proper priority ordering
- Delete local planning file after consolidation

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Critical Features First:** Must implement critical Unit features before continuing other tasks
- ✅ **Highest Priority Planning:** Critical features require highest priority above current Priority 1 tasks
- ✅ **Planning Consolidation:** Master planning.md should be single source of truth for all tasks
- ✅ **Feature Understanding:** Must fully understand requirements before implementation planning

**Quality Impact:** Critical Unit features implementation ensures solid foundation before proceeding with other tasks

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implement critical Unit features with highest priority after requirements understanding
