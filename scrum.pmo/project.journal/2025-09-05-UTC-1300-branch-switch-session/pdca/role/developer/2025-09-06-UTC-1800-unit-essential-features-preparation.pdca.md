- [ ] **Feature Analysis:** What essential features does the Unit component need?
- [ ] **Priority Assessment:** How should these features be prioritized against existing tasks?
- [ ] **Task Creation:** Should these features become highest priority tasks over all other planned tasks?
- [ ] **Implementation Strategy:** What approach should be used for implementing these essential features?

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-1800)**
```quote
before we continue with any planned task we need to add essential additional features to unit. pdca about the features i tell you in the next prompt and if i accept your understanding, add them as highest priority next tasks over all other tasks as you correctly identified the importance of units.
```

### **My Answer**
Preparing for essential Unit component features analysis. Understanding that Unit is foundational and these features will become highest priority tasks over all other planned tasks. Awaiting feature requirements in next prompt for comprehensive analysis and task creation.

**Learning Applied:** Unit component is foundational - essential features must be prioritized over all other tasks due to Unit's critical importance in Web4 ecosystem.
