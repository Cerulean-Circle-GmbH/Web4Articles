### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **PDCA Reporting Protocol**: Chat reporting must be minimal with dual links and exact QA decisions from PDCA
- [x] **Decision Authority**: User has authority over all technical decisions - "NEVER 2 1 ALWAYS 4 2" principle
- [x] **CMM3 Compliance**: Level 3 requires defined processes, templates, and tool-based verification
- [ ] **Decision 1: Application of Learned Protocols**
  - a) Apply all learned protocols immediately to current work
  - b) Create checklist for future PDCA compliance verification
  - c) Focus on specific compliance area (reporting, decisions, or CMM3)
  - d) Continue with current tasks using enhanced understanding

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-1535)**
```quote
read howto pdca, howto report into the chat and whom to let decide about problems and hiw to report decisions and what cmm3 compliance means

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Read all official PDCA documentation including howto.PDCA.md, decision-making guide, and CMMI understanding. Key learnings: Chat reporting must be minimal with dual links only, all technical decisions belong to user (NEVER 2 1 ALWAYS 4 2), and CMM3 compliance requires defined processes with tool-based verification. Creating comprehensive guide with all protocols.

**Learning Applied:** PDCA protocol requires strict compliance with chat reporting (minimal), decision authority (user owns all technical choices), and CMM3 standards (defined processes, no assumptions)

---

## **üìã PLAN**

**Objective:** Document comprehensive understanding of PDCA reporting protocol, decision-making authority, and CMM3 compliance requirements

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA Process Compliance - Official Documentation Integration

**Documentation Strategy:**
- **PDCA Reporting Protocol:** Extract chat reporting requirements from howto.PDCA.md
- **Decision Authority Framework:** Document "NEVER 2 1 ALWAYS 4 2" principle and user authority
- **CMM3 Compliance Requirements:** Define Level 3 maturity requirements and tool-based verification
- **Comprehensive Integration:** Combine all protocols for complete compliance understanding

## **üîß DO**

**Comprehensive PDCA Protocol Documentation Completed**

## **üìä PDCA CHAT REPORTING PROTOCOL**

### **Chat Reporting Requirements (CRITICAL)**
**Source:** scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md lines 230-246

#### **Mandatory Chat Format:**
- **Detailed content goes in PDCA files** - NOT in chat
- **Chat responses:** Dual-format links and NUMBERED decisions ONLY
- **"Much in files, relevant links in chat"** - TRON's explicit instruction
- **Never skip dual links** in chat responses - critical for user navigation
- **Always number decisions** with a) b) options for easy user response
- **CRITICAL:** Use EXACT same link format as in PDCA: `[GitHub](URL) | [path](path)`
- **NO summaries or explanations** in chat - just links and decisions!

#### **CRITICAL CHAT REPORTING ACCURACY:**
```
NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS IN CHAT!
- The QA Decisions shown in chat MUST be EXACTLY what's in the PDCA
- Copy-paste the exact decisions from the PDCA Summary section
- If PDCA says "All clear, no decisions to make" - say that in chat
- If PDCA has specific decisions - copy them VERBATIM to chat
- Creating different decisions in chat vs PDCA is a CRITICAL ERROR
```

#### **Standard Chat Response Format:**
```markdown
## **üìã PDCA: [Title]**

### **Artifact Links**
[GitHub](URL) | [path](path)

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed: [What was already decided]
- [ ] **Decision 1:** [Exact title from PDCA]
  - a) [Exact option from PDCA]
  - b) [Exact option from PDCA]

**[Brief status summary]** ‚úÖ
```

## **üìä DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY FRAMEWORK**

### **The 42 Principle: "NEVER 2 1 ALWAYS 4 2"**
**Source:** scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md lines 430-513

#### **Core Principle Understanding:**
**NEVER 2 1 (TO ONE) = NEVER TO ONE = Never make unilateral decisions**
**ALWAYS 4 2 (FOR TWO) = ALWAYS FOR TWO = Always collaborative decisions**

#### **‚ùå NEVER 2 1 (TO ONE) - Forbidden Unilateral Actions:**
- Never make important technical decisions alone
- Never assume methodology or tool usage approaches  
- Never say "all clear" when guidance is needed
- Never proceed with assumptions about next steps
- **NEVER MARK TASKS AS COMPLETE** without user QA approval

#### **‚úÖ ALWAYS 4 2 (FOR TWO) - Required Collaborative Approach:**
- Always ask for user guidance on important choices
- Always present real decisions when multiple options exist
- Always recognize user authority over technical approaches
- Always work collaboratively on methodology and next steps

### **User Authority Categories**
**Source:** scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md lines 460-470

#### **User Authority Over:**
- **Technical Decisions:** Tool configurations, build processes, version selections
- **Methodology Choices:** How to approach tasks, which tools to use
- **Priority Decisions:** Task order, focus areas, next steps
- **Process Control:** When to ask, when to proceed, how to enhance

#### **Agent Responsibility:**
- **Execute User Decisions:** Implement exactly as specified
- **Ask for Guidance:** Present real choices when options exist
- **Document Process:** Create comprehensive PDCA documentation
- **Report Results:** Provide detailed outcomes before next steps

### **Critical Decision Categories Requiring User Input:**
1. **Tool Usage and Configuration:** Which tools to use, how to configure them
2. **Technical Approaches:** Build processes, version selections, methodology choices
3. **Task Priority and Selection:** Which tasks to work on next, in what order
4. **Enhancement Methodology:** How to enhance tasks, what approach to take
5. **Process Deviations:** Any changes from established procedures
6. **Next Steps:** What to do after completing current work

## **üìä CMM3 COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **CMMI Level 3 (Defined) - Current Target Level**
**Source:** scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md lines 63-71

#### **Official Definition:**
"Processes are well characterized, understood, and described in standards"

#### **CMM3 Compliance Requirements:**
- **Primary Focus:** Standardized PDCA template compliance
- **Key Principle:** "Follow template EXACTLY - no variations"
- **Tool-Based Verification:** Use available tools instead of assumptions
- **Defined Processes:** All procedures must follow documented standards

#### **CMM3 Applications in Project:**
- **PDCA Documentation:** Exact template compliance required
- **Testing Processes:** Standardized vitest usage
- **Decision Making:** Defined decision-making protocols
- **Verification:** Tool-based validation instead of assumptions

### **CMM3 vs Lower Levels**
**Source:** scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md lines 52-66

#### **CMMI Level 1 (Initial):**
- **Characteristics:** Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled, reactive
- **Project Context:** "Chaos" - minimal PDCAs without structure

#### **CMMI Level 2 (Managed):**  
- **Characteristics:** Basic project management, some repeatability
- **Project Context:** Basic structure but inconsistent formats, assumptions

#### **CMMI Level 3 (Defined) - TARGET:**
- **Characteristics:** Well-defined, standardized processes
- **Project Context:** Exact template compliance, tool-based verification
- **Key Difference:** No assumptions, only defined processes and verification

### **CMM3 Verification Protocol:**
1. **Use Available Tools:** web_search, file verification, grep searches
2. **Follow Defined Templates:** PDCA template version 3.1.4.2 exactly
3. **No Assumptions:** Verify everything using available tools
4. **Documented Processes:** All procedures must follow written standards

## **üìä PRACTICAL APPLICATION SUMMARY**

### **How to Report PDCA in Chat:**
1. **Minimal Content:** Only dual links and exact QA decisions

3. **Exact Copy:** QA Decisions must be copied verbatim from PDCA
4. **Dual Links:** Always provide both GitHub and local paths
5. **Standard Format:** Use exact format specified in howto.PDCA.md

### **Whom to Let Decide About Problems:**
1. **User Authority:** ALL technical decisions belong to user
2. **Agent Role:** Execute, document, ask for guidance
3. **Decision Threshold:** When multiple valid options exist, always ask
4. **42 Principle:** When in doubt, ask - never assume

### **How to Report Decisions:**
1. **Numbered Protocol:** Use 1a, 2b format for mobile compatibility
2. **Real Options Only:** No fake opposites or "do it vs don't do it"
3. **Clear Consequences:** Explain outcomes of each option
4. **Exact Copy to Chat:** Copy decisions from PDCA exactly, no variations

### **What CMM3 Compliance Means:**
1. **Defined Processes:** Follow documented templates and procedures exactly
2. **Tool-Based Verification:** Use available tools instead of assumptions
3. **No Variations:** Exact compliance with defined standards
4. **Standardized Approach:** Well-characterized, understood processes
