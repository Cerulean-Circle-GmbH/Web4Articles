# PDCA Entry: Fix Auto-Merge Hook Bug

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Fix post-commit hook to execute auto-merge on ALL branches  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** Hook incorrectly restricted to save/start branch only  
**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-hook-bug-fix/pdca-hook-bug-fix.md

**QA Decisions:**

**Decision 1: Hook Execution Scope**
- a) Keep restriction to save/start only (current buggy behavior)
- b) Execute on ALL branches (fix the bug)
- c) Execute on specific branches only (e.g., save/*, dev/*)

**User Feedback:** "you need to ask me. the hook SHOULD execute. on every branch"

## Plan

1. **Identify the bug** - Hook has incorrect branch restriction
2. **Remove branch check** - Allow execution on all branches
3. **Add logging** - Show current branch for debugging
4. **Test the fix** - Verify auto-merge works on dev branch
5. **Document findings** - Update PDCA with results

## Do

### 1. Bug Analysis
Found in `.git/hooks/post-commit`:
```bash
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
```
This line incorrectly restricts execution to only save/start branch.

### 2. Bug Fix Applied
- Removed the branch restriction
- Added branch logging for visibility
- Added error handling for missing script
- Hook now executes on ALL branches

### 3. Fixed Hook Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîÑ Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "üìç Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
    echo "üìã Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
    bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
else
    echo "‚ùå Error: recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh not found!"
fi
```

## Check

‚úÖ Bug identified correctly  
‚úÖ Branch restriction removed  
‚úÖ Hook updated to work on all branches  
‚úÖ Added branch logging for transparency  
‚è≥ Testing pending with next commit  

## Act

### Next Steps:
1. Commit this PDCA to test the fixed hook
2. Verify auto-merge executes on dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857
3. Check if files appear in release/dev

### Learning:
- Initial setup documentation was incorrect
- Hook should work on ALL branches for consistency
- User correctly identified this as a bug, not expected behavior

### Documentation Update Needed:
- Update recovery/start-command.md to reflect correct behavior
- Remove incorrect branch restriction from documentation
