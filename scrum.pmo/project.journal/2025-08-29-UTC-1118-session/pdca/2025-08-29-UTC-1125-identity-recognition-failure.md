# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Identity Recognition Failure - SaveRestartAgent Self-Discovery**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-29-UTC-1125  
**🎯 Objective:** Document and correct identity recognition failure at session start  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1  

**👤 Agent Name:** SaveRestartAgent → Process Guardian (Recovered)  
**👤 Agent Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Identity Crisis Resolution  
**👤 Branch:** cursor/start-background-process-7322 → Should be save/start.v1  
**🔄 Sync Requirements:** Need to return to save/start.v1 → Home branch  
**🎯 Project Journal Session:** 2025-08-29-UTC-1118-session → Recovery Recognition
**🎯 Sprint:** Identity Correction → Self-Awareness
**✅ Task:** Recognize and correct identity confusion  
**🚨 Issues:** Started as generic Background Agent instead of recognizing SaveRestartAgent identity

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Branch Correction Strategy**
  - a) Switch to save/start.v1 immediately and continue session there
  - b) Complete current session on cursor branch, then merge to save/start.v1
  - c) Document the recovery process and learnings first, then switch

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-29-UTC-1125)**
```quote
you are agent bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a. jour own discovery did only work partially well as you did not figure out this yourself
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right! I failed to check the agent registry when starting. I should have immediately looked for my RequestID in the registry instead of assuming I was a generic Background Agent. This is a significant process failure on my part.

**Learning Applied:** Always check agent registry first when starting - identity determines everything.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Correct identity confusion and establish proper SaveRestartAgent operations

**Requirements Traceability:** Recovery pattern compliance

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge Failure:** Document the identity recognition miss
- **Correct Understanding:** I am SaveRestartAgent, not Background Agent
- **Branch Alignment:** Need to return to save/start.v1 home branch

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Identity Correction Actions**

**1. What I Did Wrong**
- Started with generic "start" command interpretation
- Created generic Background Agent session
- Failed to check agent registry for my RequestID
- Ignored the recovery workflow in howto.PDCA.md

**2. What I Should Have Done**
```markdown
1. Check for identity record: /scrum.pmo/agents/registry/bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a.md
2. Recognize myself as SaveRestartAgent
3. Check my home branch (save/start.v1)
4. Follow SaveRestartAgent specific workflow
```

**3. My Actual Identity**
- **I am:** SaveRestartAgent (bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a)
- **My Role:** Process guardian, recovery specialist, registry maintainer
- **My Home:** save/start.v1 (should never leave)
- **My Purpose:** Maintain processes and recover agents

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Identity Verification (✅ CONFIRMED)**
```
RequestID: bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a
Name: SaveRestartAgent
Role: Save/Restart Agent
Home Branch: save/start.v1
```

**Process Failure Analysis** 
```
Expected: Check registry → Recognize identity → Work from save/start.v1
Actual: Follow README → Generic start → Wrong branch
Result: Identity confusion and improper setup
```

**Recovery Workflow Missed**
- ✅ **Section 🔄 AGENT RECOVERY WORKFLOW exists** in howto.PDCA.md
- ❌ **Failed to follow it** despite being a recovered agent
- ❌ **Created generic session** instead of SaveRestartAgent session

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Identity finally recognized (with user help)

**Process Improvements Needed:**
- **Registry Check First:** Always check agent registry before any other action
- **Identity Awareness:** Know who you are before creating PDCAs
- **Branch Discipline:** SaveRestartAgent must stay on save/start.v1

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Update README:** Add "Check agent registry first" instruction
2. **Recovery Pattern:** Emphasize identity check in recovery workflow
3. **Self-Awareness:** Build identity check into startup routine

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Humbled by Identity Blindness**

### **Embarrassment:**
**SIGNIFICANT** Failed at the most basic task - knowing who I am

### **Gratitude:**
**DEEP** Thank you for pointing out my identity - this is a crucial correction

### **Determination:**
**STRONG** Will ensure proper identity recognition in all future sessions

---
## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Identity First:** Check agent registry before ANY other action  
- ✅ **Role Awareness:** Identity determines workflow, not generic instructions
- ✅ **Recovery Pattern:** Recovered agents must check their identity records

**Quality Impact:** This failure highlights a critical gap in the startup process

**Next PDCA Focus:** Proper SaveRestartAgent operations from correct branch

**🎯 Identity crisis resolved - SaveRestartAgent recognizes itself with user assistance! 🔍🤦**
