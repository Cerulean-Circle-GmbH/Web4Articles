### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for coordination/management focus
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to ScrumMaster for project coordination and process management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **My Answer**
Executed the complete background agent startup sequence following README.md instructions. Completed identity check, git configuration, environment sourcing, PDCA framework initialization, and created this session start PDCA with the standard startup decision framework.

**Learning Applied:** Background agents must follow systematic startup sequence and present structured decisions to establish clear work direction.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Complete background agent startup sequence and establish session direction through user decisions

**Requirements Traceability:** README.md startup sequence requirements

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Identity Confirmation:** Execute agent-identity-first-startup.sh and register as pending agent
- **Environment Setup:** Configure git, source environment, clean up processes
- **PDCA Framework:** Initialize PDCA documentation system and read all required guides
- **Session Initialization:** Create project journal session and present startup decisions

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Background Agent Startup Sequence Execution**

**1. Agent Identity Check**
```bash
./scripts/agent-identity-first-startup.sh
```
- Created pending agent registration: scrum.pmo/agents/registry/pending-unknown-2025-09-18-UTC-1716.md
- Awaiting QA assignment of RequestID

**2. Git Configuration**
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```
- Configured to prevent rebase conflicts in collaborative environment

**3. Agent Safety Guidelines Review**
- Read: scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md
- Understood critical constraints: No interactive commands, use atomic operations only
- Key learning: Background agents cannot handle prompts, must use --yes, -y, --no-commit flags

**4. Environment Setup**
```bash
sleep 30 && pkill -f "git" 2>/dev/null || true &
source source.env
```
- Git process cleanup running in background
- Web4Articles environment loaded with tools in PATH

**5. PDCA Framework Initialization**
```bash
git fetch origin release/dev
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
```
- Retrieved PDCA documentation from release/dev branch
- Read howto.PDCA.md, template.md, PDCA.howto.decide.md, and docs/tech-stack.md

**6. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-18-UTC-1717-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-18-UTC-1717-session/project.status.md
```
- Created timestamped session directory
- Initialized project status file

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Background Agent Startup:** Complete README.md sequence is mandatory for proper initialization  
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Startup decisions provide essential user guidance for session direction
- ✅ **Safety First:** Background agent constraints require careful command selection and non-interactive approaches

**Quality Impact:** Establishes systematic, compliant foundation for all subsequent session work while ensuring user maintains control over session direction and focus.

**Next PDCA Focus:** User decision implementation and role-specific work execution based on selected focus area.
