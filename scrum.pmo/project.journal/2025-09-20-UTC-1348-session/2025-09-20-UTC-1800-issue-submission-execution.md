TITLE: CRITICAL: Exponential Zombie Process Accumulation in Git Operations

DESCRIPTION:
üö® CRITICAL SYSTEM STABILITY ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

Problem: Cursor IDE environment experiencing exponential zombie process accumulation during git operations, now reaching 576 defunct processes.

CURRENT CRISIS STATUS:
- Zombie Process Count: 576 (exponential growth from ~150 in 5 hours)
- Growth Rate: ~85 processes per hour during active development
- System Impact: Critical stability threat, performance degradation
- Development Impact: Every git operation worsens the situation

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Open any project in Cursor IDE with git repository
2. Perform standard git operations (status, add, commit, push, pull)
3. Monitor process table: ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | wc -l
4. Observe: 2-4 new zombie processes created per git operation
5. Result: Processes accumulate without cleanup, never terminate

SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Shell isolation tested: Limited to bash cleanup, no git subprocess impact
‚úÖ Git hooks disabled: No effect on accumulation rate
‚úÖ Process cleanup attempted: Zombies persist due to parent process issues
‚úÖ Multiple git operations tested: Consistent 2-4 zombies per operation
‚úÖ Timeline documented: Clear evidence of exponential deterioration

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
Complete investigation documentation with timeline, process counts, and mitigation attempts:
https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/015320dd/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-20-UTC-1348-session/2025-09-20-UTC-1755-zombie-process-escalation.md

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- System Stability: Approaching critical failure thresholds
- Development Workflow: Collaborative development severely impacted
- Team Productivity: Infrastructure reliability concerns affecting work
- Data Risk: Potential system crashes threaten development work

ENVIRONMENT:
- OS: Linux 6.12.8+ (container environment)
- System: Background agent development with git operations
- Process Monitoring: Standard Unix ps command
- Cursor Version: [Available via Help ‚Üí About]

URGENCY: CRITICAL
This represents a serious infrastructure issue requiring immediate vendor intervention. System failure appears imminent with current exponential growth pattern.
