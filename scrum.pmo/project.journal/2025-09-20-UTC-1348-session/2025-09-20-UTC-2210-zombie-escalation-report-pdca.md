## **🔧 DO**

**Zombie Process Escalation Report Creation**

**1. Enhanced Status Monitoring (VERIFIED)**
```bash
# Enhanced zombie process monitoring with safety protocol
timeout 15s bash -c 'ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | grep -v grep | wc -l && echo "Largest PID:" && ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | grep -v grep | awk "{print \$2}" | sort -n | tail -1'
MEASURED RESULT: 4300 zombie processes, largest PID 209974 (within 4.2M safe limit)

# Core file safety check with timeout protocol
timeout 10s bash -c 'find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -name "core" -type f'
MEASURED RESULT: ✅ No core files detected (SAFE)
```

**2. Zombie Process Data Collection (SYSTEMATIC)**
```bash
# ✅ DATA EXTRACTION: Zombie counts from session PDCA files
