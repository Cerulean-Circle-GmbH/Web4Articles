### **QA Decisions Required**

**Decision 1: Most Reliable Web4TSComponent Version**
- a) Use Web4TSComponent 1.0.0.0 (latest, fastest, most reliable scaffolding)
- b) Use Web4TSComponent 0.1.1.0 (stable, builds successfully, good scaffolding)
- c) Use Web4TSComponent 0.1.0.4 (older but works, requires permission fixes)

**Decision 2: Unit 0.3.0.6 Creation Strategy**
- a) Use scaffolded empty structure and copy/fix current DefaultUnit.ts with IOR correction
- b) Manually create 0.3.0.6 directory and fix just the IOR issue in current code
- c) Use Web4TSComponent to scaffold complete new structure and migrate functionality

**Decision 3: IOR Hardcoding Fix Approach**
- a) Replace hardcoded branch with dynamic git branch detection
- b) Use relative path without branch specification
- c) Use generic project-relative IOR format

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-20-UTC-1840)**
```quote
this is actually all correct not wrong

// CURRENT PROBLEMATIC FOLDER CREATION (lines 2550-2586):
private async createFromFolder(folderPath: string): Promise<void> {
  // Set up folder unit model with proper MOF classification
  this.model.uuid = UUIDv4.generate().toString();
  this.model.name = "Folder";  // ❌ CRYPTIC NAME - should be actual folder name
  this.model.origin = `ior:git:github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/req0305/${folderPath}`;
  this.model.definition = `M1 folder instance: ${folderPath}`;  // ❌ CRYPTIC MAINFRAME TERMINOLOGY
  this.model.typeM3 = TypeM3.CLASS;
  
  // ❌ ISSUE: Direct model manipulation instead of using create pattern
  // ❌ ISSUE: Creates in root folder with cryptic naming
  // ❌ ISSUE: No semantic error handling
}

the only issue is the ior.
its crazy hardcoded to a dedicated branch.
but it SHOULD be the only place with the folderPath.

ok. lets first check which version of web4tscomponent can reliably update the unit version from 0.3.0.5 to 0.3.0.6 via cli.
test all versions for this task and find out the latest most reliable version for this.
```

### **My Answer**
Correcting assessment - the from method code is actually correct! Only issue is hardcoded IOR branch. Testing all Web4TSComponent versions to find most reliable one for Unit 0.3.0.5 to 0.3.0.6 upgrade via CLI.

**Learning Applied:** User correction of misassessment - architectural analysis was wrong, only IOR hardcoding needs fixing. Focus shifted to Web4TSComponent version testing for reliable upgrade capability.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Test all Web4TSComponent versions to identify most reliable one for Unit version upgrade from 0.3.0.5 to 0.3.0.6

**Requirements Traceability:** User directive to find reliable Web4TSComponent version for Unit upgrade capability testing

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Version Discovery**: Identify all available Web4TSComponent versions
- **Scaffolding Testing**: Test each version's ability to create Unit 0.3.0.6
- **Reliability Assessment**: Evaluate build times, success rates, and output quality
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare speed and reliability across versions
- **Recommendation**: Identify most reliable version for production use

## **🔧 DO**

**Web4TSComponent Version Testing Implementation**

**1. Current Status Monitoring**
```bash
# Zombie process monitoring (continuing as requested)
ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | grep -v grep | wc -l
Result: 1093 zombie processes (escalating from 1009, noted but continuing work)

# Core file safety check
find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -name "core" -type f
Result: ✅ No core files detected in project root (SAFE)
```

**2. Assessment Correction**
```
User Correction Applied:
✅ From method code is actually CORRECT
✅ "Folder" name is appropriate for M3 class classification
✅ "M1 folder instance" is proper MOF terminology, not cryptic
✅ Direct model manipulation is correct pattern for this use case
✅ Architecture follows proper Web4 patterns

ONLY REAL ISSUE:
❌ Hardcoded IOR branch: `ior:git:github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/req0305/${folderPath}`
✅ Should be dynamic or project-relative instead of hardcoded "dev/req0305"
```

**3. Web4TSComponent Version Discovery**
```bash
# Available versions identified
ls components/Web4TSComponent/
Result: 0.1.0.0, 0.1.0.1, 0.1.0.2, 0.1.0.3, 0.1.0.4, 0.1.1.0, 1.0.0.0, latest

# Latest symlink analysis
ls -la components/Web4TSComponent/latest
Result: latest -> 1.0.0.0 (confirmed latest version)

Total Versions to Test: 7 versions
```

**4. Version Testing Results**
