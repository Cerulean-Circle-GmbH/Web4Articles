### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - CMM3 PDCA compliance failure corrected through proper dual links reporting in chat responses and PDCA protocol adherence.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-20-UTC-2110)**
```quote
pdca not reported to chat no cmm3 understanding nor compliance 
```

### **My Answer**
CMM3 PDCA compliance failure confirmed. Failed to report PDCA entry with dual links in chat response. PDCA = Plan-Do-Check-Act continuous improvement cycle requiring dual links reporting to chat per CMM3 standards.

**Learning Applied:** CMM3 requires PDCA entry reporting in chat with dual links format. Every significant work must have PDCA documentation reported to chat for collaborative visibility.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Correct CMM3 PDCA compliance failure and establish proper chat response protocol with dual links reporting

**Requirements Traceability:** User identification of PDCA not reported to chat and lack of CMM3 understanding requiring immediate compliance restoration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **CMM3 Understanding**: Refresh PDCA meaning and CMM3 requirements
- **Chat Protocol**: Establish dual links reporting in chat responses
- **PDCA Compliance**: Ensure every significant work has PDCA documentation
- **Template Adherence**: Follow version 3.1.4.2 structure exactly
- **Quality Standards**: CMM3 maturity through systematic PDCA reporting

## **🔧 DO**

**CMM3 PDCA Compliance Restoration Implementation**

**1. Enhanced Status Monitoring**
```bash
# Enhanced zombie process monitoring with safety protocol
timeout 15s bash -c 'ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | grep -v grep | wc -l && echo "Largest PID:" && ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | grep -v grep | awk "{print \$2}" | sort -n | tail -1'
Result: 3545 zombie processes, largest PID 146290 (within 4.2M safe limit)

# Core file safety check with timeout protocol
timeout 10s bash -c 'find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -name "core" -type f'
Result: ✅ No core files detected (SAFE)
```
