## Plan

**Demo Execution Strategy:**
Now that we have achieved production-ready ONCE CLI through comprehensive architecture improvements, the next logical step is to execute the actual ONCE demo to validate all session achievements in practice. This represents the culmination of our comprehensive learning and implementation journey.

**Session Context Integration:**
- **Comprehensive Learning ✅:** Complete understanding of Web4, PDCA, CMMI, ONCE architecture
- **Radical OOP Resolution ✅:** 671-line JavaScript violation eliminated, Web4 TypeScript architecture perfected
- **CLI Production Ready ✅:** Command consistency, direct TypeScript execution, full test capabilities
- **Network Fallback ✅:** Robust localhost fallback for reliable demo execution
- **Message Component ✅:** Web4-compliant messaging with scenario acknowledgment

**Demo Objectives:**
1. **Interactive Demo Validation:** Execute `once demo` to demonstrate full interactive capabilities
2. **Test Sequence Demonstration:** Use `once demo "s5q"` to validate automated testing workflow
3. **Browser Integration:** Confirm auto-opening browser with enhanced Web4 interface
4. **Component Integration:** Validate Message component scenario acknowledgment functionality
5. **Cross-Platform Validation:** Demonstrate ONCE kernel's universal deployment capabilities

**Success Metrics:**
- Complete interactive demo execution without errors
- Browser client auto-opening and connecting successfully
- Message component acknowledgment scenarios working
- Test sequence automation functioning perfectly
- Server lifecycle management (start/stop) operating correctly

## Do

**🚀 ONCE PRODUCTION DEMO EXECUTION:**

### **Phase 1: Interactive Demo Launch**
**Objective:** Execute full interactive ONCE demo using production CLI

**Demo Execution Plan:**
- Launch `once demo` for full interactive experience
- Validate server startup and client connections
- Test browser auto-opening functionality  
- Demonstrate Message component integration
- Verify scenario exchange and acknowledgment system

### **Phase 2: Automated Test Sequence Validation**
**Objective:** Demonstrate production test capabilities

**Test Sequence Scenarios:**
- Execute `once demo "s5q"` - Start server, wait 5 seconds, quit
- Execute `once test "s312d2e1q"` - Full demo sequence with clients
- Validate command consistency (demo vs test commands)
- Confirm headless vs interactive mode routing

### **Phase 3: Component Integration Demonstration**
**Objective:** Showcase Web4 Message component in action

**Integration Validation:**
- Browser client Message component functionality
- Scenario acknowledgment workflow
- Real-time statistics and connection monitoring
- Cross-platform message exchange demonstration

### **Phase 4: Architecture Excellence Validation**
**Objective:** Demonstrate complete Web4 architecture compliance

**Architecture Validation:**
- Empty constructor pattern compliance
- Scenario-based initialization
- Direct TypeScript execution (no shell spawning)
- Clean component layering and separation
