- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles across different components
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific Web4Articles component or feature
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state and component status review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development or architecture changes

### **TRON Feedback (Not applicable for session start)**

### **My Answer**
Session initialized successfully with PDCA framework established. All startup procedures completed according to background agent protocol. Ready for user direction selection.

**Learning Applied:** Background agent startup must establish clear work direction through structured decision framework

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Approach:**
1. **Complete Background Agent Initialization** - Follow startup protocol from recovery/start-command.md
2. **Establish PDCA Workflow** - Ensure proper documentation framework for session
3. **Present Standard Startup Decisions** - Use decision framework for user work direction
4. **Prepare Development Environment** - Branch management and automation setup

**Expected Outcomes:**
- User receives clear work direction options
- Session properly documented in PDCA format
- Development branch established for session work
- Git automation enabled for efficient workflow

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Follow mandatory 6-section PDCA format
- Ensure all GitHub links functional after commit/push
- Maintain dual link system throughout session
- Apply startup decision framework correctly
