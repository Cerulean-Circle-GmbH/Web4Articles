### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1405)**
```quote
find in git log the web4tscomponent v 0.3.0.6 that had 💯 test success
```

### **My Answer**
Investigation completed! Found Web4TSComponent with **PERFECT SUCCESS: 100% test pass rate achieved** in git commit `3d75ceb3`. However, this achievement was for **version 0.3.0.8**, not 0.3.0.6 as requested. The commit shows **37/37 tests passing (100% success rate)** with all core functionality working perfectly.

**Learning Applied:** Systematic git history analysis reveals testing achievements and version-specific progress tracking

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Approach:**
1. **Git History Analysis** - Search commit messages for Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.6 with 💯 or 100% test success
2. **Multiple Search Strategies** - Use grep patterns, commit filtering, and content analysis
3. **Version-Specific Investigation** - Focus on 0.3.0.6 specifically while tracking related achievements
4. **Documentation Analysis** - Examine PDCA files and test validation tables for evidence

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Locate specific commit with Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.6 and 💯 test success
- Document test achievement details and context
- Provide git commit hash and verification details
- Clarify any version discrepancies found

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Use multiple search approaches for comprehensive coverage
- Cross-reference commits with actual file content
- Apply systematic testing methodology for accuracy
- Document negative results if version 0.3.0.6 not found with 💯
