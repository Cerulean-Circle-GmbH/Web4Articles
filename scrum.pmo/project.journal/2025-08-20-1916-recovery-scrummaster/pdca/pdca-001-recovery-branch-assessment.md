# 📋 **PDCA Cycle 001: Recovery and Branch Assessment**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-20T19:16:00Z  
**🎯 Objective:** Complete recovery process and assess release/dev branch state  
**👤 Role:** ScrumMaster  
**🚨 Issues:** Working on outdated branch, need to understand current project state

---

## **📊 Summary**

Performed recovery from README.md as ScrumMaster on an outdated branch (cursor/scrum-master-readme-recovery-9259) that was 339 commits behind main. Successfully switched to release/dev branch which contains 600 commits and 739 new files since the common ancestor.

### **⚖️ QA Decisions Required**

- [Pending] **Sprint 8 Execution**: Should we proceed with Sprint 8 tasks on release/dev branch?
- [Pending] **PDCA Process**: Confirm this PDCA format meets enhanced requirements

## **📝 Plan**

### **Critical Issues to Address**
1. **Branch Currency**: Was on branch 339 commits behind main from August 11
2. **Recovery Context**: Need to understand current project state on release/dev
3. **Process Compliance**: Must follow enhanced PDCA process with full traceability

### **Recovery and Assessment Scope**
- Execute README.md recovery procedure
- Assess branch options and switch to most current
- Document findings in PDCA format
- Create project journal session

---

## **🔧 Do**

### **Recovery Execution**

#### **Initial Recovery**
- Read README.md and followed Optimized Recovery Procedure
- Checked handover.backend.agent.md (minimal content)
- Scanned PMO structure: 6 roles, 9 sprints (0-8)
- Reviewed recovery.md history and qa-feedback-log.md
- Updated recovery.md with timestamped entry

#### **Branch Assessment**
- Discovered current branch was from August 11 (f89aba0)
- Found 339 commits behind main, 31 commits ahead
- Checked newest branches: release/dev most recent
- Analyzed cannot fast-forward, must choose branch

#### **Branch Switch to release/dev**
- Successfully switched to local-dev tracking origin/release/dev
- Found 600 commits since common ancestor
- Discovered 739 new files added, 36 modified, 3 deleted
- Identified new directories: projects/, Documentation/, articles/, scripts/

#### **Session Creation**
- Created new journal session: 2025-08-20-1916-recovery-scrummaster
- Created pdca subdirectory for enhanced PDCA documentation
- Writing this PDCA as first entry following enhanced template

## **✅ Check**

### **QA Feedback**
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-20T19:14:00Z  
**User Feedback:** "no. read the latest scrum master process and pdca process. then create a new session and write and reprot your first pdca to me."

### **Recovery Completion**
✅ **README Recovery**: Completed autonomous recovery procedure ✅  
✅ **Branch Assessment**: Identified release/dev as most current branch ✅  
✅ **Process Documentation**: Read latest ScrumMaster process.md ✅  
✅ **PDCA Template**: Located and using enhanced PDCA template ✅  

### **Gaps Identified**
❌ **PDCA Metadata**: Need to add traceability metadata per process ❌  
❌ **Previous PDCA Reference**: First PDCA, no previous reference available ❌  
❌ **Commit SHA**: Not yet committed, SHA pending ❌  

---

## **🚀 Act**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Complete PDCA Metadata**: Add required traceability information
2. **Commit and Push**: Commit this PDCA and get SHA for documentation
3. **Sprint 8 Planning**: Review Sprint 8 status and plan next steps

### **Enhanced PDCA Compliance Strategy**
Following the enhanced PDCA requirements from ScrumMaster process.md:
- Include artifact links for all modified files
- Add GitHub links for QA verification
- Document commit SHAs for traceability
- Create cross-reference links for related work

### **Critical Gap Priorities**
1. **PDCA Traceability**: Establish baseline for future PDCA cycles
2. **Sprint Coordination**: Determine Sprint 8 execution approach
3. **Process Learning**: Document learnings from enhanced PDCA process

### **Success Metrics**
- PDCA includes all required metadata fields
- Clear traceability chain established
- QA can verify all changes through provided links
- Recovery context preserved for future reference
