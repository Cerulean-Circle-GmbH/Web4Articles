# Project State — 2025-08-12 09:00 UTC

**Status:** Recovered from root README; refreshed governance, CI/CD plan, and sprint posture.

## GitHub Quick Links
- **Repo**: [Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles)
- **Branches**: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) · [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev) · [release/testing](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/testing) · [release/production](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/production)
- **PRs**: [Open PRs](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/pulls) · [All branches](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/branches)

## Project status (ScrumMaster)
- **Role**: ScrumMaster (autonomous), coordinating Developers/Testers and enforcing DRY, strict ESM TS, and radical OOP
- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main)

## Environment
- Docker: Not installed
- Node: v22.16.0; npm 10.9.2
- PlantUML/Graphviz: Not installed locally
- Devcontainer: Planned under sprint-4

## Tests
- Not run in this routine (no code changes)
- Action: Run full suite after merge cleanups to verify [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) and [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)

## Branching and CI/CD
- Primary branches: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) (prod), [release/production](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/production) (mirror), [release/testing](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/testing) (created 2025-08-11), [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev) (created 2025-08-11)
- Automation (planned): `feature-to-dev.yml`, `auto-merge-release-dev.yml`, `sync-production.yml`, `quality-checks.yml`, weekly promotion to `release/testing`
- Status:
  - QA recognized 100% branch coverage in [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev) on 2025-08-11
  - Sprint 9 integration report: 6/14 merged, 8 pending with conflicts; key hotspots: `recovery.md`, `index.md`, QA logs, sprint tasks, Ranger files ([merge report](../../merge-report-sprint-9.md))
- Recommendations:
  - Prioritize branch containing v2 merge scripts; complete remaining merges
  - Implement weekly promotion and finalize CI wiring
  - Clean up already-merged branches after verification

## Sprints Overview
- Existing: sprints 0–4 on [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main)
- Discovered/Merged: sprint 5–6 (TSRanger v2), sprint 8 (Ranger analysis)
- Missing: sprint 7
- Created: sprint 9 (CI/CD pipeline and branch integration)
- Upcoming: sprint 10 (License enforcement tooling via `TSsh LicenseTool`)

## Recent Activity
- Branch overview and merge logs added; backend handover note present ([handover](../../handover.backend.agent.md))
- QA log updated with achievement recognition (2025-08-11) ([QA log](../../qa-feedback-log.md))
- ResearchAgent integration noted in recovery log ([recovery](../../recovery.md))

## Risks/Blockers
- Merge conflict backlog across documentation and code
- Branch promotion automation pending
- Minor Node engine warnings previously observed for some dev tools

## Next Steps
- Run full test suite on [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) and [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- Resolve conflicts for pending branches; prioritize v2 merge tooling branch
- Wire GitHub Actions as per branching strategy; verify protection rules
- Update `index.md` and cross-links post-merge
- Document outcomes in `recovery.md` and `qa-feedback-log.md`
