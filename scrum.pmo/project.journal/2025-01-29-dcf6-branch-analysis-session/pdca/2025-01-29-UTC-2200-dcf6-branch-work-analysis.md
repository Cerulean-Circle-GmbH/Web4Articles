### **TRON Feedback (2025-01-29T21:45:00Z)**
```quote
i also need /workspace/scrum.pmo/agents from the other branch.

then read /scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
DO NOT SWITCH or create any branches, but read and understand the pdca prompt command.

the other agent wanted to see which work was done in branch cursor/start-background-process-dcf6.
can you apply the same save merge and give me a detailed pdca.
```
