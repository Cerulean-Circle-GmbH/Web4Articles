### **My Answer**
Initiating background agent session following Web4Articles startup protocol. Created session directory, read PDCA framework documentation, and prepared startup decision framework for user selection.

Decisions received: Quality/Testing Focus, Tester role, Quick analysis session. Transitioning to Tester role for project state analysis with focus on testing strategies, validation, and compliance checks.

**Learning Applied:** Following the README.md startup protocol ensures proper PDCA framework initialization and structured decision-making process. User selections clearly define session direction toward quality assurance work.

## **📋 PLAN**
**Session Initialization Protocol:**
1. ✅ Check PDCA documentation existence - Found at scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
2. ✅ Read PDCA Guide for template format, decision framework, dual links
3. ✅ Create session directory with UTC timestamp: 2025-08-28-UTC-1341-session
4. ✅ Create project status file
5. 🔄 Create Session Start PDCA with startup decision framework
6. ⏳ Create new dev branch for session work
7. ⏳ Present standard 3 decisions to user for session direction

**Startup Decision Framework Application:**
- Present Focus Area options covering technical, architectural, process, and quality aspects
- Offer role selection based on focus area capabilities
- Provide session duration options matching work complexity requirements

## **🔧 DO** 
**Execution Steps:**

1. **PDCA Framework Initialization:**
   - Verified PDCA documentation exists: ✅
   - Read howto.PDCA.md and PDCA.howto.decide.md: ✅
   - Understanding gained: 6 mandatory sections, dual-link system, UTC timestamps, startup decisions

2. **Session Directory Creation:**
   - Created: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1341-session/
   - Created project.status.md with UTC timestamp
   - Prepared for PDCA documentation

3. **Startup Decision Framework Implementation:**
   - Applied 3-category decision structure from PDCA.howto.decide.md
   - Customized focus areas for Web4Articles project context
   - Prepared role selection options matching project capabilities
   - Structured session duration options for flexible planning

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**PDCA Framework Compliance (✅ PASSED)**
```
✅ 6 mandatory sections present
✅ UTC timestamp format: 2025-08-28-UTC-1341
✅ Dual-link system prepared for GitHub URLs
✅ Startup decision framework implemented
✅ Session directory structure created
```

**Session Structure Verification (✅ PASSED)**
```
