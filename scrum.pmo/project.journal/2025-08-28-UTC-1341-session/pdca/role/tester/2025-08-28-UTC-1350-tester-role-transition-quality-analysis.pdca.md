### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Testing Infrastructure Priority**
  - a) Install Vitest dependencies immediately and verify all existing tests pass

  - c) Create comprehensive test audit document before any infrastructure changes
  - d) Parallel approach: Install dependencies while conducting analysis

- [ ] **Decision 2: Test Coverage Assessment Approach**
  - a) Component-by-component detailed analysis starting with TSRanger (most test files)
  - b) Framework-level analysis focusing on Vitest compliance and Jest elimination
  - c) Requirement-driven analysis mapping tests to sprint tasks and acceptance criteria
  - d) Quality gate analysis focusing on compliance checks and validation strategies

- [ ] **Decision 3: Immediate Quality Improvements Focus**
  - a) Fix broken test infrastructure (Vitest not found) and get existing tests running
  - b) Address false negative tests identified in previous PDCA documentation  
  - c) Implement comprehensive testing matrix for TSRanger components
  - d) Create project-wide testing standards and compliance documentation

### **My Answer**
Transitioning to Tester role for quality/testing focused session. Conducted initial analysis revealing Vitest framework adoption, extensive TSRanger test coverage, but infrastructure installation needed. Ready to prioritize quality improvements based on user guidance.

**Learning Applied:** Session decisions clearly define testing focus with quick analysis scope, enabling targeted quality assessment and improvement strategy

## **📋 PLAN**
**Testing Infrastructure & Quality Analysis Strategy:**

1. **Current State Assessment:**
   - ✅ Analyzed project testing framework: Vitest (Jest banned)
   - ✅ Identified 85+ test files across TSRanger, GitScrumProject, Web4Test components
   - ✅ Found comprehensive testing documentation and PDCA history
   - ⚠️ Discovered Vitest dependencies not installed (npm test fails)

2. **Testing Framework Compliance:**
   - ✅ Tech stack clearly mandates Vitest over Jest
   - ✅ Configuration exists: vitest.config.ts with proper setup
   - ✅ Multiple component versions have established test patterns
   - ❌ Dependencies missing preventing test execution

3. **Quality Strategy Analysis Focus:**
   - Map existing test coverage to requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Identify test infrastructure gaps and installation priorities
   - Assess compliance with project testing standards
   - Review false negative test elimination from previous sessions

4. **Decision Points for User:**
   - Infrastructure installation priority vs analysis priority
   - Coverage assessment methodology selection
   - Immediate improvement focus area determination

## **🔧 DO** 
**Quality Analysis Execution:**

### **1. Testing Framework Assessment**
**Current Framework Status:**
- **Adopted:** Vitest as primary testing framework
- **Banned:** Jest explicitly prohibited in tech-stack.md
- **Configuration:** vitest.config.ts properly configured with node environment
- **Timeout Settings:** 30s test/hook timeouts configured
- **Environment Variables:** V2_TESTS=1 for alternate test path selection

**Test File Distribution:**
```
Components with Tests:
- TSRanger: v1.0 (1), v2.0 (5), v2.1 (5), v2.2 (5), v2.5 (3) = 19 total
- GitScrumProject: v1.0 (1 test file)
- Web4Test: v1.0 (testing component)
Total: 20+ test files across multiple component versions
```

### **2. Infrastructure Installation Status**
**Critical Issue Identified:**
```bash
npm test
> vitest run
sh: 1: vitest: not found
```

**Dependencies Status:**
- ✅ package.json has vitest: ^3.2.4 in devDependencies
- ❌ node_modules missing vitest installation
- ❌ Cannot execute any tests until npm install completed

### **3. Test Coverage Quality Analysis**
**TSRanger Test Patterns (Most Mature):**
- ✅ Model tests (tsranger.model.test.ts)
- ✅ Prompt tests (tsranger.prompt.test.ts) 
- ✅ Completion tests (TSCompletion.test.ts)
- ✅ Requirements tests (tsranger.unambiguous-requirements.test.ts)
- ✅ Key combination tests (tsranger.dry-key-combinations.test.ts)
- ✅ Regression prevention tests (v2.2 has CMM level 3 prevention)

**Documentation Quality:**
- ✅ Comprehensive testing matrix exists
- ✅ Test automation scripts for systematic execution
- ✅ Test reports with UUID mapping for traceability
- ⚠️ Previous PDCA indicates 0/32 tests passing (infrastructure issue)

### **4. Quality Standards Compliance**
**Following Project Standards:**
- ✅ All test files use Vitest imports: `import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';`
- ✅ No Jest dependencies or configurations detected
- ✅ Test files organized in component-specific test/ directories
- ✅ Non-interactive test approach documented in PDCA guidelines

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Testing Framework Compliance (✅ PASSED)**
```
✅ Vitest adoption verified across all test files
✅ Jest elimination confirmed in tech-stack.md
✅ Configuration file vitest.config.ts properly structured
✅ Test file patterns follow project standards
❌ Dependencies installation required for execution
```

**Test Coverage Analysis (⚠️ PARTIAL)**
```
✅ TSRanger components have extensive test coverage (19 files)
✅ Test patterns consistent across component versions
✅ Comprehensive testing matrix documentation exists
⚠️ Cannot verify test execution without dependency installation
❌ 0/32 tests passing status from previous PDCA sessions
```

**Quality Process Verification (✅ PASSED)**
```
✅ PDCA documentation shows systematic testing focus
✅ False negative test elimination efforts documented
✅ Regression prevention tests implemented
✅ Test automation and reporting infrastructure exists
✅ Requirement UUID mapping for traceability
```

**Infrastructure Status Assessment (❌ FAILED)**
```
❌ npm test fails with "vitest: not found"
❌ Cannot execute any quality validation without installation
❌ Testing infrastructure broken despite proper configuration
⚠️ Requires immediate dependency installation for progress
```

2. **Infrastructure Fix:** npm install to resolve Vitest dependency issue
3. **Test Execution:** Validate existing test suite functionality
4. **Coverage Analysis:** Map test results to component requirements

**Quality Improvement Strategy:**
Based on user decisions, implement:
- Infrastructure repair and validation
- Systematic test coverage analysis
- Compliance verification and gap identification
- Testing standard enhancement and documentation

**Session Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Tester role transition completed with proper PDCA documentation
- ✅ Current testing state comprehensively analyzed
- ⏳ User decisions received for priority guidance
- ⏳ Infrastructure installation and test execution
- ⏳ Quality improvements identified and prioritized

**Next PDCA Focus:** 
Implementation of selected testing infrastructure and quality improvement priorities based on user decision guidance

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Role transition requires comprehensive current state analysis before improvement planning
- ✅ **Quality Assessment:** Infrastructure gaps must be identified before coverage analysis can be meaningful
- ✅ **Testing Strategy:** Vitest adoption represents systematic approach to modern testing practices
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Multiple valid approaches require user guidance for priority selection

**Quality Impact:** Tester role analysis reveals strong testing foundation with infrastructure gap requiring immediate attention for quality validation capability

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implementation of user-selected testing infrastructure and quality improvement priorities with focus on infrastructure repair and systematic test validation
