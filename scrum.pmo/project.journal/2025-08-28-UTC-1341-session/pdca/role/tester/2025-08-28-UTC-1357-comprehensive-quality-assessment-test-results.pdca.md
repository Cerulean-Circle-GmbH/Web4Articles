## **🔧 DO** 
**Quality Assessment Implementation:**

### **1. Test Execution Results Analysis**
**Overall Test Status:**
```
✅ Infrastructure: Vitest working, 18 test files discovered
📊 Test Metrics: 223 total tests across TSRanger components
❌ Quality Status: 107 failed (48%), 115 passed (52%), 1 skipped
⏱️ Performance: 59.35s duration, tests completing within timeout
```

**Test File Distribution:**
- **TSRanger v2.0:** 5 test files (model, prompt, completion, requirements, key combinations)
- **TSRanger v2.1:** 5 test files (same pattern + unambiguous requirements)
- **TSRanger v2.2:** 5 test files (same + CMM Level 3 regression prevention)
- **TSRanger v2.5:** 3 test files (subset pattern)
- **GitScrumProject v1.0:** 1 test file (template repo creation)

### **2. Critical Failure Pattern Analysis**

#### **Category 1: Navigation State Management (HIGH IMPACT)**
**Issue:** Empty prompt lines and navigation failures
- **Failed Tests:** Multiple `expect(promptLine).toMatch(/\w+/)` assertions returning empty strings
- **Root Cause:** TSRanger navigation not producing expected output states
- **Impact:** Core functionality broken, user experience severely compromised

#### **Category 2: Filter Clearing Logic (HIGH IMPACT)**  
**Issues:** Filter residue and incomplete clearing operations
- **Failed Tests:** `expect(result.promptBuffer).toBe('')` returning filtered content
- **Examples:** "g" filter persisting after retreat operations
- **Impact:** User confusion, inconsistent behavior patterns

#### **Category 3: Method Display Consistency (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
**Issues:** Method advancement and display inconsistencies  
- **Failed Tests:** Tab advancement not showing methods as expected
- **Examples:** `expect(result.selectedColumn).toBe(1)` failing (staying at 0)
- **Impact:** Tab workflow broken, advancement mode failures

#### **Category 4: DRY Principle Violations (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
**Issues:** Identical operations producing different results
- **Failed Tests:** Left/ShiftTab retreat equivalence failures
- **Examples:** Navigation vs filter approaches showing different outcomes
- **Impact:** User confusion, unpredictable behavior patterns

#### **Category 5: CMM Level 3 Regression Prevention (HIGH IMPACT)**
**Issues:** Regression prevention tests failing systematically
- **Failed Tests:** Multiple regression prevention scenarios in v2.2
- **Impact:** Quality process failures, systematic regression risk

### **3. TSRanger Component Maturity Assessment**

#### **TSRanger v2.2 (Most Advanced)**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Model, prompt, completion, requirements, key combinations, CMM regression
- ❌ **Quality Status:** CMM Level 3 regression prevention tests failing
- ⚠️ **Critical Issues:** Tab advancement consistency failures, filter clearing problems
- 📊 **Assessment:** Most feature-complete but regression-prone

#### **TSRanger v2.1 (Mature)**  
- ✅ **Good Coverage:** Unambiguous requirements focus, comprehensive key combinations
- ❌ **Quality Status:** Navigation and filter clearing failures
- ⚠️ **Critical Issues:** DRY principle violations, method display inconsistencies
- 📊 **Assessment:** Solid foundation with systematic behavior issues

#### **TSRanger v2.0 & v2.5**
- ✅ **Basic Coverage:** Core functionality patterns established
- ❌ **Quality Status:** Similar failure patterns as newer versions  
- ⚠️ **Critical Issues:** Completion and filter logic problems
- 📊 **Assessment:** Foundation components with inherited quality issues

### **4. Quality Impact Assessment**

**Critical Quality Gaps:**
1. **User Experience Breakdown:** Empty prompt lines make tool unusable
2. **Navigation Workflow Failures:** Core tab advancement broken
3. **Filter Logic Inconsistencies:** Unpredictable clearing behavior
4. **Regression Prevention Failures:** Quality process breakdown

**Business Impact:**
- **High:** Core TSRanger functionality unreliable for production use
- **Medium:** Developer productivity impact from broken testing workflows  
- **Low:** Documentation and edge case handling issues
