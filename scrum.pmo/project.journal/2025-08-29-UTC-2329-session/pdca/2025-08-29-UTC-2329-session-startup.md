### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks
  - e) Recovery/Analysis Focus - analyze recovery.md and recovery.analysis directory

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for coordination and initialization
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to ScrumMaster for project coordination and sprint management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **My Answer**
Understood! I'm starting as a Background Agent. I've initialized the PDCA framework, created the session directory and project status, and now present you with the startup decisions to establish our work direction.

**Learning Applied:** Following the startup decision framework ensures clear alignment from session beginning.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Initialize background agent session with PDCA framework and establish clear work direction

**Requirements Traceability:** Session initialization per README.md startup procedures

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **PDCA Framework Check:** Verify PDCA documentation exists and is accessible
- **Session Structure Creation:** Create timestamped session directory and project status
- **Decision Framework Application:** Present standard startup decisions for user direction

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Verified PDCA Framework Availability**
```bash
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
# Result: File exists and is accessible
```

**2. Created Session Directory Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-29-UTC-2329-session
```

**3. Created Project Status Documentation**
```markdown
# Project Status - 2025-08-29 UTC
[Full status document created with session information]
```

**4. Read and Applied PDCA Guidelines**
- Reviewed howto.PDCA.md for template version 3.0 requirements
- Studied PDCA.howto.decide.md for startup decision framework
- Examined template.md for proper format structure

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**PDCA Framework Status (✅ READY)**
```
- howto.PDCA.md: Available and read
- PDCA.howto.decide.md: Decision framework understood
- template.md: Version 3.0 format confirmed
```

**Session Structure Creation (✅ COMPLETE)** 
```

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Startup Framework:** Three standard decision categories establish clear direction  
- ✅ **Session Organization:** Proper directory structure enables systematic work
- ✅ **Background Agent Role:** Autonomous operation with systematic documentation

**Quality Impact:** Proper session initialization ensures consistent quality throughout work session

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implementation of user's selected focus area with appropriate role
