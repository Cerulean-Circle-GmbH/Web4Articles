# Project State - Test Matrix v3 Session

**Session:** 2025-08-17-2030-test-matrix-v3  
**Branch:** dev/sprint5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 5  
**Task:** Task 3 - Test Matrix Implementation

## Session Summary

This session focused on reverting TSRanger v2.0 to a known good state and creating a comprehensive Test Matrix v3 documenting actual behavior.

## Key Activities

1. **Code Reversion**
   - Reverted TSRanger v2.0 to commit 2345bfe (pre-test.matrix state)
   - Files: RangerController.ts, RangerView.ts

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Tested navigation sequences ([down] commands)
   - Tested advancement sequences ([down]+[tab] combinations)
   - Verified v1 vs v2 behavioral differences

3. **Documentation**
   - Created test.matrix.v3.md with 30+ test cases
   - Incorporated QA feedback from 6 PDCA sessions
   - Identified 5 critical bugs and 4 architectural issues

## Current State

### Working Features
- Basic navigation with arrow keys
- Tab advancement from class to method selection
- Clear separation between navigation and advancement modes

### Known Issues
1. **g[tab]** - Filter advancement bug (no method shown)
2. **g[tab][left]** - Filter residue in prompt
3. **[down]×5[tab]** - Navigation state prevents advancement
4. **g[right][down][left]** - Filter not cleared properly
5. **g[down]** - Sets unwanted filter during navigation

### Architectural Concerns
1. DRY violations - Multiple prompt update paths
2. OOP violations - Poor encapsulation
3. Mixed responsibilities across MVC layers
4. Condition logic flaw in advancement method

## Files Modified

```
scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-5/test.matrix.v3.md (created)
scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-2030-test-matrix-v3/ (new session)
components/TSRanger/v2.0/src/ts/layer4/RangerController.ts (reverted)
components/TSRanger/v2.0/src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts (reverted)
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix critical bugs starting with g[tab] advancement
2. Ensure all test matrix cases pass
3. Refactor architecture to address DRY/OOP violations
4. Implement automated tests from matrix

## Recovery Status

✅ Successfully recovered to known good state  
✅ Comprehensive test coverage documented  
✅ Clear path forward with prioritized bug fixes
