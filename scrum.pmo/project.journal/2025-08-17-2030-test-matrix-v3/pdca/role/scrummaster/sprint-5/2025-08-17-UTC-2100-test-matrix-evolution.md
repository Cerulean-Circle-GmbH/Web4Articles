- [x] Performed systematic testing of v1 vs v2 behavior
- [x] Created comprehensive Test Matrix v3 based on findings

**🎯 Outcomes**
- Clear documentation of decision-making process
- Traceability from recovery to test matrix creation
- Knowledge preservation for future reference
- Established testing methodology

## **📝 Plan**

**Objective:** Document the evolution from recovery to Test Matrix v3

**Context:**
- Recovery agent requested to "recover from readme"
- Discovery of TSRanger behavioral discrepancies
- Need for systematic approach to document expected behavior

**Documentation Strategy:**
1. Trace the conversation flow from recovery to test matrix
2. Highlight key decision points
3. Reference created artifacts
4. Establish connections between discoveries and actions

## **⚙️ Do**

### **Journey Timeline**

**1. Recovery Initiation**
- User request: "recover from readme"
- Executed autonomous recovery procedure per README.md
- Updated recovery.md with findings (2025-08-11 entry)

**2. Branch Creation & Merge**
- Created `dev/sprint5` branch
- Merged `release/dev` with conflict resolution
- Read Sprint 5 planning and requirements

**3. Code Reversion Discovery**
- User request: "revert the tsranger v2 code to a point directly before the test.matrix.md was introduced"
- Analysis revealed test.matrix.md introduced around commit 711932a
- Reverted to commit 2345bfe (just before test matrix work)

**4. Manual Testing Phase**
- User request: "test manually tsranger test '[down]5' in v1 and v2"
- Discovered v1 shows "[Classes] (5)" while v2 properly navigates
- User: "v2 behaves correct. test what happens with two,3,4,5,6 down inputs"
- Systematic testing of [down] sequences revealed consistent behavior

**5. Tab Testing Addition**
- User: "perfect. now add a tab after each test and check again"
- Discovered [tab] acts as advancement key
- [down][tab] combinations properly transition to method selection
- Clear separation between navigation and advancement modes

**6. Test Matrix v3 Creation**
- User: "nice. now create a test.matrix.v3.md from your findings"
- Created comprehensive test matrix documenting:
  - Navigation behavior (6 test cases)
  - Tab advancement behavior (6 test cases)
  - Key differences from v1
  - Behavioral summary

**7. PDCA Integration**
- User: "based on the pdcas and qa feedback add more cases to the test matrix v3"
- Analyzed Sprint 5 QA feedback and PDCAs
- Added 25+ additional test cases covering:
  - Filter mode operations
  - Complex navigation sequences
  - Cursor position tracking
  - Identified bugs from QA feedback

**8. PDCA Documentation**
- User: "now find out how to write a pdca and write a comprehensive pdca"
- Created PDCA following project format: [2025-08-17-UTC-2030-test-matrix-v3-creation.md](./2025-08-17-UTC-2030-test-matrix-v3-creation.md)
- Documented entire process with metrics and outcomes

### **Key Decisions Made**

1. **Reversion Decision**: Rather than debug forward, revert to known good state
2. **Testing Approach**: Manual testing before automation to understand behavior
3. **Documentation First**: Create test matrix before fixing bugs
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include both working features and bugs

### **Artifacts Created**

1. **Test Matrix v3**: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-5/test.matrix.v3.md`
2. **PDCA Documentation**: Current session journal entries
3. **Project State**: Session state documentation

## **✅ Check**

### **Process Validation**

**✅ Recovery to Resolution Path:**
1. Recovery → Discovery → Investigation → Testing → Documentation
2. Each step built on previous findings
3. User feedback incorporated at each stage

**✅ Decision Traceability:**
- Each major decision has clear rationale
- User requests drove investigation direction
- Findings influenced next steps

**✅ Knowledge Capture:**
- Behavioral differences documented
- Bug patterns identified
- Architectural issues surfaced

### **Quality Metrics**

- **Conversation Steps**: 8 major phases
- **Test Cases Generated**: 30+
- **Bugs Discovered**: 5 critical
- **PDCAs Referenced**: 6 sessions
- **Files Created**: 3 major artifacts

## **🎬 Act**

### **Immediate Value Delivered**

1. **Clear Testing Baseline**: Test Matrix v3 provides definitive behavior spec
2. **Bug Documentation**: Known issues tracked with reproduction steps
3. **Process Documentation**: This PDCA captures decision flow
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Future developers can understand evolution

### **Process Insights**

1. **Iterative Discovery**: Each test revealed new aspects
2. **User-Driven Investigation**: Responsive to specific requests
3. **Systematic Approach**: Methodical testing yields comprehensive results
4. **Documentation Value**: Capturing "why" as important as "what"

### **Recommendations**

1. **Test-First Recovery**: When recovering, establish tests immediately
2. **Incremental Validation**: Test each assumption before proceeding
3. **User Collaboration**: Tight feedback loops improve outcomes
4. **Knowledge Management**: Document decision processes, not just results

### **Future Application**

This journey demonstrates effective:
- Problem investigation methodology
- Collaborative debugging approach
- Documentation-driven development
- Knowledge preservation practices
