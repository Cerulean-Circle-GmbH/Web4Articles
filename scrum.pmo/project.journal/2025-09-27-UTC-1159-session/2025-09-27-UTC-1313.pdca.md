## **🔧 DO**

**do what you planned with savety protocoll per CMM3 item 1f step 3:**

**Phase 1: Branch Publication to Remote (Steps 3-4)**

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section per CMM3 item 1f step 4:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Push current branch changes first
git push origin dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028
# Result: 1 commit pushed to current branch

# Phase 2: Publish start/save.v5 branch to remote
git push origin start/save.v5
# Result: [new branch] start/save.v5 -> start/save.v5 (remote branch created)

# Phase 3: Switch to start/save.v5 branch for merge
git checkout start/save.v5
# Result: Switched to branch 'start/save.v5'
```
✅ **Branch Publication:** start/save.v5 successfully published to remote repository

**Phase 2: Merge Integration from Current Branch (Step 5)**
```bash
# Merge latest changes from dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028
git merge dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028
# Result: Fast-forward merge - 4 files changed, 542 insertions(+)
# Files: 2025-09-27-UTC-1257.pdca.md, cmm3.compliance.checklist.md, 
#        2025-09-27-UTC-1304.pdca.md, howto.PDCA.md

# Push merged changes to remote
git push origin start/save.v5
# Result: a2807fc9 pushed to origin/start/save.v5
```
✅ **Merge Integration:** Latest changes from dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028 merged into start/save.v5

**Phase 3: Verification and Status Check (Step 6)**
```bash
# Verify current status and branch state
git status
git log --oneline -3
# Result: On branch start/save.v5, all changes merged and pushed
```
✅ **Verification Complete:** Branch published, merged, and synchronized with remote

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**write how you will check it in the check section and what outputs you need to verify how with command quotes per CMM3 item 1f step 5:**

**Verification Commands per CMM3 compliance:**
```bash
# Verify remote branch publication success
git ls-remote --heads origin | grep start/save.v5
# Should show: refs/heads/start/save.v5 (remote branch exists)

# Verify current branch and merge status
git branch --show-current && git status
# Should show: start/save.v5 branch active, clean working directory

# Verify merge integration success
git log --oneline dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028..HEAD
# Should show: No commits (branches synchronized)

# Confirm remote synchronization
git status -uno
# Should show: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/start/save.v5'"
```
