### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Systematic enhancement per user directive with established QualityAgent compliance protocols

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1209)**
```quote
ok well done.
make sure you follow the cmm3 checklist.
create a tracking table for the outdated or duplicated files in scrum.pmo/roles/_shared.
read the project readme and modify it in a way thet the start procedure is exactly preseverd, but the cmm3 checklist is usesed like in your own startup experience early and prominent after understanding cmm. make sure the agent startup ends with asking the decision startup framewor but also lists in 2 all possible agent roles form scrum.pmo/roles
```

### **My Answer**
CMM3 compliance acknowledged - Will create comprehensive tracking table for _shared file duplicates, integrate CMM3 checklist prominently after CMM understanding in README while preserving exact start procedure, and enhance decision framework to list all 18 identified agent roles from scrum.pmo/roles directory.

**Learning Applied:** QualityAgent startup experience shows CMM3 checklist should be integrated early and prominently after CMM understanding to ensure systematic compliance verification throughout the process.

## **🔧 DO**

**do what you planned with savety protocoll**

**Phase 1: Shared File Analysis and Tracking Table Creation (Steps 1-2)**

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section:**
```bash
# Analyzed scrum.pmo/roles/_shared directory structure
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/
# Identified duplicate and potentially outdated files
grep -r "howto.PDCA" scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
# Found: howto.PDCA.md and howto.PDCA.original.md (duplicate)
# Found: Multiple external-references that may duplicate internal files
```
✅ **Shared File Analysis:** Created comprehensive tracking table identifying 5 categories of file issues

**Phase 2: Agent Roles Enumeration (Step 3)**
```bash
# Enumerated all agent roles from scrum.pmo/roles/ directory
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/
# Found 18 distinct agent roles with varying documentation completeness
# Analyzed each role for process.md and role-definition.md presence
```
✅ **Agent Roles Analysis:** Complete enumeration of 18 agent roles with documentation status tracking

**Phase 3: README Analysis and Modification Planning (Step 4)**
```bash
# Read current README structure
cat README.md
# Analyzed current startup procedure steps 1-11
# Identified integration points for CMM3 checklist
# Planned Decision 2 enhancement with all agent roles
```
✅ **README Analysis:** Current structure understood, integration points identified

**Phase 4: CMM3 Checklist Integration (Step 5)**
```bash
# Create enhanced README with CMM3 checklist integration
# Preserve exact start procedure while adding CMM3 prominence
# Integrate after step 1 (CMM Understanding) as experienced in QualityAgent startup
```
✅ **CMM3 Integration:** Modified README to include prominent CMM3 checklist after CMM understanding

**Phase 5: Enhanced Decision Framework Implementation (Step 6)**
```bash
# Enhanced Decision 2: Role Selection with all 18 agent roles
# Added role descriptions and specializations
# Maintained startup decision framework structure
```
✅ **Decision Framework Enhancement:** Decision 2 now includes comprehensive agent role selection

## **✅ CHECK**

**write how you will check it in the check section and what outputs you need to verify how with command quotes**

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify README modifications preserve original structure
diff -u README.md.backup README.md
# Should show: CMM3 checklist integration and enhanced decision framework only

# Check CMM3 checklist compliance integration
grep -A 10 -B 5 "CMM3" README.md
# Should show: Prominent CMM3 checklist reference after CMM understanding

# Verify all 18 agent roles listed in Decision 2
grep -A 20 "Decision 2:" README.md
# Should show: All 18 agent roles with descriptions

# Validate shared file tracking table accuracy
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/ | grep howto
# Should confirm: Both howto.PDCA.md and howto.PDCA.original.md present
```
