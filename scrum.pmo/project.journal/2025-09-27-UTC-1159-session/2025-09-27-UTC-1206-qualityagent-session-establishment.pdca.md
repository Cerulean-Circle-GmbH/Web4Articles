### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Session establishment per user directive with established QualityAgent role and documentation focus

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1206)**
```quote
create a new project session for youself and pdca there with your current role.
```

### **My Answer**
Session establishment acknowledged - Creating dedicated 2025-09-27-UTC-1159-session with QualityAgent operational framework. This provides isolated context for systematic process compliance work with documentation focus established in previous role assignment.

**Learning Applied:** Dedicated sessions enable focused quality work without context switching - CMM4 systematic approach to role specialization and process excellence.
