  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks and component development
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing framework work
  - e) Switch to Requirements Analyst for specification and documentation work

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles and comprehensive component work

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-26-UTC-0931)**

### **My Answer**
I am a Background Agent initializing the Web4Articles DAPP session with proper PDCA framework. I've successfully:
- Verified PDCA documentation exists
- Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931 branch for session work  
- Installed git post-commit hooks for auto-merge
- Created session directory structure
- Applied startup decision framework with three key decision categories

**Learning Applied:** Following the startup decision framework to present meaningful choices about work direction, role selection, and session planning rather than proceeding without user alignment.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
Implement the complete startup procedure from recovery/start-command.md and apply the startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md to establish clear session direction and user alignment.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- User selects work focus area, role, and session duration
- Clear direction established for productive session
- PDCA framework properly initialized
- Auto-merge workflow operational

### **Dependencies**
- User response to startup decisions (1a, 2b, 3c format)
- PDCA documentation and templates available
- Git workflow operational

## **🚀 DO**

### **Session Initialization Steps Completed**

1. **✅ Branch Management**
   - Started on cursor/start-background-process-23b6
   - Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931 branch
   - Established proper branch hierarchy

2. **✅ PDCA Framework Setup**
   - Verified howto.PDCA.md exists (cherry-pick not needed)
   - Read startup decision framework guidelines
   - Read template format requirements

3. **✅ Git Automation**
   - Installed post-commit hook for auto-merge to release/dev
   - Hook configured to trigger on save/start branch commits

4. **✅ Session Structure**
   - Created scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session/
   - Created project.status.md
   - Created PDCA directory structure

5. **✅ Decision Framework Application**
   - Applied startup decision framework with three standard categories
   - Customized options based on current project context
   - Focused on Web4Articles DAPP priorities and component structure

### **Implementation Details**

**Git Command Experience During Startup:**

**1. Branch Discovery and Transition:**
```bash
git branch --show-current  # Revealed: cursor/start-background-process-23b6
```
- **Experience**: Started on temporary cursor/* branch as expected
- **Action**: Immediately transitioned per startup procedure guidelines

**Branch Creation:**
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")  # Generated: 2025-09-26-UTC-0931
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
```
- **Experience**: Smooth branch creation and remote setup
- **Result**: GitHub suggested PR creation automatically
- **Learning**: UTC timestamp format ensures unique session branches

**2. Git Hook Installation:**
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```
- **Experience**: Hook created successfully and became executable
- **Validation**: Hook triggered during commit showing "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
- **Learning**: Hook correctly detects it's on dev/* branch and doesn't execute merge (correct behavior)

**3. Commit SHA Discovery:**
```bash
git log -1 --format="%H - %s"  # Result: 43d96a6c8b61e95c965cdd9f1570f9dd0b30ebf6 - docs: Add branch recovery completion log
```
- **Experience**: Easy access to previous commit for PDCA traceability
- **Usage**: Updated PDCA header with previous commit SHA per template requirements

**4. File Creation and Staging:**
```bash
# Session directory creation
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M") && mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/$TIMESTAMP-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/$TIMESTAMP-session/project.status.md
```
- **Experience**: Directory structure created successfully
- **Result**: Proper session isolation with UTC timestamps

**5. PDCA Creation Process:**
- **Manual Process**: Created comprehensive PDCA following template.md structure
- **Challenge**: Had to update commit SHA after creation (chicken-and-egg problem)
- **Solution**: Initial placeholder, then search_replace after file creation

**6. Main Commit Sequence:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: session start PDCA with startup decision framework..."  # Created: cf0d28b9
git push origin dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931
```
- **Experience**: Clean commit with comprehensive message
- **Result**: New commit cf0d28b9 successfully pushed
- **Hook Action**: Post-commit hook executed but correctly didn't merge (dev/* branch)

**7. Dual Link Fix Cycle:**
```bash
# Fix broken local paths in PDCA
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct dual links in session start PDCA..."  # Created: 801b35da
git push origin dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931
```
- **Experience**: Caught and fixed broken relative paths
- **Learning**: Dual links require careful relative path calculation from PDCA location
- **Validation**: Both GitHub and local links now functional

**Session Directory Structure:**
```
scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session/
├── project.status.md
└── pdca/
    └── role/
        └── background-agent/
            └── 2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session-start.md
```

## **🔍 CHECK**

### **Validation Results**

**✅ Process Compliance**
- PDCA format follows template.md structure (6 mandatory sections)
- Startup decision framework correctly applied
- Session directory properly created
- Git workflow established

**✅ Technical Setup**
- Branch management per startup procedure
- Auto-merge hooks installed and configured
- Session timestamping consistent (2025-09-26-UTC-0931)
- Working directory properly established

**✅ Decision Quality**
- Three decisions represent genuine choices with distinct outcomes
- Options based on actual project context and capabilities
- Focus areas aligned with Web4Articles DAPP architecture
- Role options matched to project requirements

**✅ Git Command Experience Validation**
- **Branch Management**: Successfully transitioned from cursor/* to dev/* branch
- **Commit Traceability**: Three commits created during startup:
  - `43d96a6c` (previous) → `cf0d28b9` (initial PDCA) → `801b35da` (dual link fix)
- **Hook Installation**: Post-commit hook working correctly (triggered but didn't merge on dev/* branch)
- **Dual Link Integrity**: Fixed broken relative paths, both GitHub and local links functional
- **File Organization**: Session directory properly structured with UTC timestamps

**⚠️ Pending Validation**
- User response to startup decisions required
- Auto-merge functionality will be tested on save/start branch operations
- Session work direction depends on user decision selection

### **Decision Context Analysis**

**Decision 1 - Work Focus:** Based on project structure showing active components (TSRanger, Web4Requirement, Web4Test, etc.), active development branches, and comprehensive testing/documentation framework.

**Decision 2 - Role Selection:** Background Agent offers coordination capabilities, but project shows need for specialized roles based on component complexity and development requirements.

**Decision 3 - Session Duration:** Options scaled to project complexity - from quick analysis to extended development sessions for major features.
