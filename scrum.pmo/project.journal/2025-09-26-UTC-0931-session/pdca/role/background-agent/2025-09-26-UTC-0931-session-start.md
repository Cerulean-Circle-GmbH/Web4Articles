### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, TSRanger improvements, testing framework updates
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design improvements, process optimization, integration work, component relationships
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation workflow, PDCA process improvements, project documentation
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation frameworks, compliance checks, component testing

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for coordination and process management
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks and component development
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing framework work
  - e) Switch to Requirements Analyst for specification and documentation work

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles and comprehensive component work
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component or process improvement
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review and planning
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development or architecture changes

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-26-UTC-0931)**

### **My Answer**
I am a Background Agent initializing the Web4Articles DAPP session with proper PDCA framework. I've successfully:
- Verified PDCA documentation exists
- Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931 branch for session work  
- Installed git post-commit hooks for auto-merge
- Created session directory structure
- Applied startup decision framework with three key decision categories

**Learning Applied:** Following the startup decision framework to present meaningful choices about work direction, role selection, and session planning rather than proceeding without user alignment.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
Implement the complete startup procedure from recovery/start-command.md and apply the startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md to establish clear session direction and user alignment.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- User selects work focus area, role, and session duration
- Clear direction established for productive session
- PDCA framework properly initialized
- Auto-merge workflow operational

### **Dependencies**
- User response to startup decisions (1a, 2b, 3c format)
- PDCA documentation and templates available
- Git workflow operational

## **🚀 DO**

### **Session Initialization Steps Completed**

1. **✅ Branch Management**
   - Started on cursor/start-background-process-23b6
   - Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0931 branch
   - Established proper branch hierarchy

2. **✅ PDCA Framework Setup**
   - Verified howto.PDCA.md exists (cherry-pick not needed)
   - Read startup decision framework guidelines
   - Read template format requirements

3. **✅ Git Automation**
   - Installed post-commit hook for auto-merge to release/dev
   - Hook configured to trigger on save/start branch commits

4. **✅ Session Structure**
   - Created scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session/
   - Created project.status.md
   - Created PDCA directory structure

5. **✅ Decision Framework Application**
   - Applied startup decision framework with three standard categories
   - Customized options based on current project context
   - Focused on Web4Articles DAPP priorities and component structure

### **Implementation Details**

**Branch Creation:**
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
```

**Git Hook Installation:**
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Session Directory Structure:**
```
scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session/
├── project.status.md
└── pdca/
    └── role/
        └── background-agent/
            └── 2025-09-26-UTC-0931-session-start.md
```

## **🔍 CHECK**

### **Validation Results**

**✅ Process Compliance**
- PDCA format follows template.md structure (6 mandatory sections)
- Startup decision framework correctly applied
- Session directory properly created
- Git workflow established

**✅ Technical Setup**
- Branch management per startup procedure
- Auto-merge hooks installed and configured
- Session timestamping consistent (2025-09-26-UTC-0931)
- Working directory properly established

**✅ Decision Quality**
- Three decisions represent genuine choices with distinct outcomes
- Options based on actual project context and capabilities
- Focus areas aligned with Web4Articles DAPP architecture
- Role options matched to project requirements

**⚠️ Pending Validation**
- User response to startup decisions required
- GitHub links will be validated after commit/push
- Auto-merge functionality will be tested on save/start branch operations

### **Decision Context Analysis**

**Decision 1 - Work Focus:** Based on project structure showing active components (TSRanger, Web4Requirement, Web4Test, etc.), active development branches, and comprehensive testing/documentation framework.

**Decision 2 - Role Selection:** Background Agent offers coordination capabilities, but project shows need for specialized roles based on component complexity and development requirements.

**Decision 3 - Session Duration:** Options scaled to project complexity - from quick analysis to extended development sessions for major features.

   ```

2. **Present Decisions to User**
   - Report PDCA creation with dual links
   - Present three startup decisions for user selection
   - Wait for user response in "1a, 2b, 3c" format

3. **Execute User Selections**
   - Apply chosen work focus area
   - Switch to selected role if different from Background Agent
   - Plan session activities based on duration selection

### **Continuous Improvement Notes**

**Process Enhancement:**
- Startup decision framework provides clear structure for session initialization
- Automatic branch creation with UTC timestamps ensures proper session isolation
- Git hooks enable seamless integration with release workflow

**Template Evolution:**
- PDCA template 3.1.4.2 provides comprehensive structure
- Startup decisions create meaningful choice points for user alignment
- Session directory structure supports organized artifact management

### **Dependencies for Next Actions**

- User response to three startup decisions
- Potential role switch based on Decision 2 selection
- Session planning based on Decision 3 duration choice
- Component-specific work definition based on Decision 1 focus
