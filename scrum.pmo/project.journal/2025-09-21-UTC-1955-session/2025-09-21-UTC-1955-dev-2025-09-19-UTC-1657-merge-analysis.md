pdca about what needs to be merged from
dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657
```

### **My Answer**
Excellent point! I need to analyze what additional work might exist on dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 that needs to be merged into dev/0306. When I created the new branch, there might have been subsequent commits on the original branch that should be integrated.

**Learning Applied:** Branch creation requires comprehensive analysis of source branch to ensure no valuable work is lost in transition.

## **🔧 DO**

**Branch Merge Analysis Implementation**

**1. Branch State Comparison**
```bash
# Check current branch status
git branch --show-current
# Result: dev/0306

# Compare branch histories
git log --oneline dev/0306 | head -5
git log --oneline origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 | head -5

# Find commits on source branch not in target branch
git log --oneline origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 ^dev/0306
```

**2. Commit Difference Analysis**
```bash
# Identify specific commits that might need merging
git cherry dev/0306 origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657

# Check for file differences between branches
git diff dev/0306 origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 --name-only

# Analyze specific file changes
git diff dev/0306 origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 --stat
```

**3. Work Content Assessment**
```bash
# Check for new PDCAs or session work
find scrum.pmo/project.journal -name "*.md" -newer-than="1 hour ago"

# Check for component updates
git diff dev/0306 origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 -- components/

# Check for script updates
git diff dev/0306 origin/dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 -- scripts/
```

**4. Integration Requirements Evaluation**
```bash
# Categories of potential merge requirements:

# Category 1: Session Documentation
# - Additional PDCAs created after branch point
# - Session summary updates
# - Coverage analysis updates

# Category 2: Component Enhancements
# - SessionSummary component improvements
# - Other component updates
# - Version updates

# Category 3: Infrastructure Changes
# - Script updates
# - Configuration changes
# - Tool enhancements

# Category 4: Quality Improvements
# - CMM3 compliance updates
# - Template adherence improvements
# - Safety protocol implementations
```
