### **Implementation Error Identified**
- **Wrong Approach:** Used scaffold-component to create new nextBuild from scratch
- **Correct Approach:** Should have used web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 to upgrade existing 0.3.0.6
- **Trash Created:** New scaffolded component instead of proper upgrade
- **Merge Strategy:** Need to merge automation work into proper upgrade without waste

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Implementation Error Acknowledged:** Used wrong web4tscomponent approach
- [x] **Correct Tool Identified:** Should use web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade function
- [x] **Merge Strategy Required:** Integrate automation work into proper upgrade
- [x] **Trash Cleanup:** Remove incorrect scaffolded version and use proper upgrade

you should have used 
web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 on SessionSummary 0.3.0.6 upgrade nextBuild

figure it out and merge your work without creating too muck trash!
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right! I used the wrong approach - I should have used web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 to upgrade the existing SessionSummary 0.3.0.6 to nextBuild, not scaffold a new component. I need to:

**Correct Implementation:**
- Use web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade function on existing 0.3.0.6
- Merge my automation work into the proper upgrade
- Remove the trash scaffolded version

**Learning Applied:** Component upgrades should use proper upgrade tools, not scaffolding from scratch.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Correct implementation using web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade and merge automation work without creating trash

**Requirements Traceability:** User correction that proper upgrade tool should be used instead of scaffolding

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Remove Trash:** Delete incorrectly scaffolded nextBuild version
- **Proper Upgrade:** Use web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade on existing 0.3.0.6
- **Merge Automation:** Integrate automation methods into proper upgrade
- **Clean Implementation:** Avoid duplicate work and maintain clean component structure

## **🔧 DO**

**Web4TSComponent Upgrade Correction Implementation**

**1. Current Situation Analysis**
```bash
# Wrong implementation created:
# - components/SessionSummary/nextBuild (scaffolded from scratch)
# - Contains automation methods but wrong approach

# Correct approach should be:
# - Use web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade on existing 0.3.0.6
# - Merge automation work into proper upgrade
# - Clean up trash from wrong approach
```

**2. Web4TSComponent v0.3.0.7 Upgrade Research**
```bash
# Check web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 capabilities:
/workspace/scripts/web4tscomponent --help
# Look for upgrade commands or version management

# Proper upgrade command should be:
# web4tscomponent upgrade SessionSummary 0.3.0.6 nextBuild
# OR similar upgrade function
```

**3. Automation Work Extraction**
```typescript
// Extract valuable automation work from trash nextBuild:
// - onSessionSummaryGenerated() method
// - analyzeComponentWork() method
// - updateCoverageTrackingTable() method
// - updateSessionsDocumentation() method
// - updateCompleteCoverageAnalysis() method
// - updateComponentSessionLinks() method
// - ComponentWork interface

// Merge into proper upgrade without duplication
```

**4. Clean Implementation Strategy**
```bash
# Step 1: Remove trash scaffolded version
rm -rf /workspace/components/SessionSummary/nextBuild

# Step 2: Use proper web4tscomponent-v0.3.0.7 upgrade
# (Research correct upgrade command)

# Step 3: Merge automation methods into proper upgrade
# (Add automation methods to properly upgraded component)

# Step 4: Clean up and validate
# (Ensure no duplicate work or trash left behind)
```
