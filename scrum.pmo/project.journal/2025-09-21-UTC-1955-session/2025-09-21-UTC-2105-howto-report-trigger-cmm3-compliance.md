### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2105)**
```quote
check in the pdca a trigger if the howto report in the chat is mentiones and start to follow it cmm3 again.
```

### **My Answer**
Excellent protocol enhancement! I need to add a trigger to detect when "howto report" is mentioned in chat and follow CMM3 compliant chat reporting:

**Howto Report Trigger:** Detect mentions of howto report in PDCA content
**CMM3 Chat Reporting:** Follow proper chat reporting format and protocol
**Protocol Integration:** Enhance PDCA trigger with howto report detection
**Compliance Restoration:** Return to CMM3 chat reporting standards

**Learning Applied:** Howto report mentions should trigger CMM3 compliant chat reporting protocol activation.

## **🔧 DO**

**Howto Report Trigger CMM3 Compliance Implementation**

**1. Howto Report Trigger Addition to PDCA Protocol**
```markdown
# Add to howto.PDCA.md PDCA Trigger Learning Protocol section:

## **📋 HOWTO REPORT TRIGGER - CMM3 CHAT REPORTING**

### **When "howto report" Mentioned in PDCA - Automatic CMM3 Chat Compliance**

**MANDATORY RESPONSE PROCESS:**
1. **Detect Howto Report Mention:**
   - Scan PDCA content for "howto report" references
   - Check user feedback for chat reporting protocol mentions
   - Identify CMM3 compliance requirements

2. **Activate CMM3 Chat Reporting:**
   - Follow strict minimal chat format as per howto PDCA
   - Report only: Dual links + QA decisions + essential status
   - Move detailed content to PDCA document
   - Maintain CMM3 compliant chat brevity

3. **Chat Format Compliance:**
   - Dual links: [GitHub](URL) | [§/path](path)
   - QA decisions: Brief decision points only
   - Essential status: Minimal completion status
   - PDCA reference: Direct link to comprehensive analysis

**CMM3 CHAT REPORTING CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Howto report mention detected in content
- [ ] CMM3 chat format applied (minimal, dual links, decisions)
- [ ] Detailed content moved to PDCA document
- [ ] Chat brevity maintained per howto PDCA protocol
- [ ] Dual links working (GitHub and § local paths)
- [ ] Essential status only in chat response
```

**2. CMM3 Chat Reporting Format Specification**
```markdown
# CMM3 Compliant Chat Response Format:

## **Brief Status Report:**
**Work Complete:** [Brief one-line status]

**PDCA Analysis:** [GitHub](URL) | [§/path](path)

**QA Decisions:**
- [x] **Decision 1:** Brief decision description
- [ ] **Decision 2:** Brief pending decision
- [x] **Decision 3:** Brief completed decision

**Essential Status:** [Minimal completion status]

# ALL DETAILED CONTENT GOES IN PDCA DOCUMENT
# CHAT MAINTAINS BREVITY PER CMM3 STANDARDS
```

**3. Protocol Integration with Existing PDCA Trigger**
```markdown
# Enhanced PDCA Trigger Protocol:

**When User Writes "pdca" - Enhanced Process:**
1. **Self-Check Previous Response** (existing)
2. **Learn and Correct** (existing)
3. **Generate Chat PDCA** (existing)
4. **NEW: Check for Howto Report Trigger**
   - Scan PDCA content for "howto report" mentions
   - If found: Activate CMM3 chat reporting compliance
   - Apply minimal chat format with PDCA reference
   - Move detailed content to PDCA document

**Howto Report Detection Pattern:**
- Keywords: "howto report", "chat reporting", "CMM3 chat", "reporting protocol"
- Context: User feedback about chat format or reporting style
- Action: Activate CMM3 compliant minimal chat reporting
- Format: Dual links + decisions + essential status only
```

**4. Implementation in Howto PDCA Documentation**
```bash
# Update /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
# Add new section after existing PDCA Trigger Learning Protocol
# Title: "HOWTO REPORT TRIGGER - CMM3 CHAT REPORTING"
# Content: Complete detection and compliance framework
```
