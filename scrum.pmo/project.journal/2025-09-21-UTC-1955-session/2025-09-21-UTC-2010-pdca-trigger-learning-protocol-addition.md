### **PDCA Trigger Learning Protocol Required**
- **Trigger Word:** When user writes "pdca", agent should self-check previous response
- **Compliance Check:** Analyze what was wrong with previous response against CMM3 standards
- **Learning Protocol:** Re-read template and safety protocols to correct compliance
- **Chat Report:** Create and report proper PDCA in chat with corrected compliance

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **PDCA Trigger Protocol Required:** Need automatic self-check when user writes "pdca"
- [x] **CMM3 Self-Check Framework:** Analyze previous response against template compliance
- [x] **Learning Integration:** Re-read protocols and apply corrections automatically
- [x] **Chat PDCA Report:** Generate proper PDCA in chat response with compliance

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2010)**
```quote
add to the howto pdca, that when i write pdca you check what was wrong with the previous response and learn again how to comply cmm3 to create and report a pdca in the chat.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Excellent protocol enhancement! When you write "pdca", I should automatically:

**Self-Check Previous Response:**
- Analyze what was wrong with my previous response against CMM3 standards
- Check template compliance, dual link format, safety protocol usage
- Identify specific violations or missing elements

**Learn and Correct:**
- Re-read template version 3.1.4.2 and safety protocols
- Apply corrections to ensure proper CMM3 compliance
- Generate proper PDCA in chat with corrected format

**Learning Applied:** PDCA trigger should activate automatic compliance self-check and corrective learning protocol.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Add PDCA trigger learning protocol to howto PDCA for automatic CMM3 compliance self-check

**Requirements Traceability:** User request to add automatic PDCA compliance checking when "pdca" trigger used

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Protocol Addition:** Add PDCA trigger section to howto.PDCA.md
- **Self-Check Framework:** Define automatic compliance checking process
- **Learning Integration:** Include template and protocol re-reading requirement
- **Chat Report Format:** Specify proper PDCA generation and reporting in chat

## **🔧 DO**

**PDCA Trigger Learning Protocol Addition Implementation**

**1. Previous Response Self-Check Analysis**
```markdown
# ANALYZING PREVIOUS RESPONSE FOR CMM3 COMPLIANCE ISSUES:

# Previous Response Analysis:
# - Documentation analysis provided
# - Identified sessions documentation severely outdated (6 vs 68+ components)
# - Coverage analysis verified as current and accurate
# - Merge analysis completed (no merge needed)

# CMM3 COMPLIANCE CHECK:
# ✅ Template structure: Followed template version 3.1.4.2
# ✅ Dual links: Provided GitHub and § local links
# ✅ TRON feedback: Captured user request verbatim
# ✅ Safety protocols: Used timeout commands
# ❌ ISSUE: Did not create comprehensive PDCA for the analysis itself
# ❌ ISSUE: Should have provided more structured documentation update plan

# LEARNING REQUIRED:
# - Always create formal PDCA when user says "pdca"
# - Provide comprehensive analysis with systematic approach
# - Include specific implementation steps and validation
```

## **🎯 PDCA TRIGGER LEARNING PROTOCOL**

### **When User Writes "pdca" - Automatic Self-Check and Correction**

**MANDATORY RESPONSE PROCESS:**
1. **Self-Check Previous Response:**
   - Analyze what was wrong with previous response against CMM3 standards
   - Check template version 3.1.4.2 compliance
   - Verify dual link format, safety protocol usage, TRON capture
   - Identify specific violations or missing elements

2. **Learn and Correct:**
   - Re-read template.md and safety protocols if violations found
   - Apply corrections to ensure proper CMM3 compliance
   - Implement systematic approach to identified issues

3. **Generate Chat PDCA:**
   - Create proper PDCA document for the work/analysis
   - Report PDCA in chat with corrected CMM3 compliance
   - Provide working dual links (commit before providing GitHub URLs)
   - Include comprehensive analysis and implementation steps

**PDCA TRIGGER CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Previous response analyzed for CMM3 compliance
- [ ] Template and safety protocols re-read if needed
