### **My Answer**
Understood! I'm executing the Background Agent startup procedure as specified in the README.md instructions. I've successfully initialized the PDCA framework, created the session structure, and established a development branch. I'm now presenting the standard startup decision framework to determine our work focus, role selection, and session planning approach.

**Learning Applied:** Following the structured Background Agent initialization process ensures proper PDCA compliance and systematic session setup.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish proper development session foundation using PDCA methodology and startup decision framework

**Requirements Traceability:** README.md instructions for Background Agent startup

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Framework Initialization:** Fetch latest PDCA documentation and ensure compliance with template v3.1.4.2
- **Session Structure:** Create proper project journal session directory with UTC timestamp and development branch
- **Decision Presentation:** Apply startup decision framework with three standard categories for user guidance

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Background Agent Initialization Sequence**

**1. PDCA Framework Initialization**
```bash
# Check and fetch PDCA documentation
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
git fetch origin release/dev
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
```

**2. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
# Create session directory with UTC timestamp
UTC_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-25-UTC-1523-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-25-UTC-1523-session/project.status.md
```

**3. Development Branch Establishment**
```bash
# Create and push new development branch
git checkout -b dev/2025-09-25-UTC-1523
git push -u origin dev/2025-09-25-UTC-1523
```

**4. PDCA Structure Creation**
```bash
# Create PDCA directory and session start documentation
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-25-UTC-1523-session/pdca
# Create this PDCA document with startup decision framework
```

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work including session initialization
- ✅ **Startup Framework:** Three-category decision structure provides effective user guidance for session planning  
- ✅ **Branch Strategy:** UTC-timestamped development branches enable proper session isolation and tracking
- ✅ **Background Agent Role:** Autonomous operation requires structured initialization following documented procedures

**Quality Impact:** Proper PDCA-compliant session initialization ensures systematic documentation, decision tracking, and quality maintenance throughout the development session.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Role-specific work based on user decisions, maintaining PDCA documentation for all significant activities during the session.
