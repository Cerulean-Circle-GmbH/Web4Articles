### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1a Implemented**: Create completely new standalone howto PDCA document replacing current version, abandoning howto.pdca.essential references
- [x] **Decision 2c Implemented**: Comprehensive coverage including all session learnings plus the 5 core areas (chat reporting, decisions, dual links, terminal, naming)
- [x] **Decision 3a Implemented**: Systematically verify all dual links in first 2 levels and cherry-pick any missing files to ensure complete functionality

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-1218)**
```quote
1a and abandon the howto.pdca.essential references by that
2c
3a
4c
make it possible that your document is enough to start, but mention with working dual links the original files if the future agents context requires more detail 
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect! I'll create a completely new standalone howto PDCA document with comprehensive coverage that's self-sufficient for new agent start, verify all dual links with cherry-picking, and create both test scenario and live testing. The document will abandon essential references while providing working dual links to comprehensive documentation for agents needing more detail.

**Learning Applied:** Self-sufficient documentation enables immediate new agent competency while maintaining references to deeper knowledge - comprehensive standalone approach with optional depth via working dual links.
