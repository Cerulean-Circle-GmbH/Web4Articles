### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Process trust validated with core technical changes preserved through successful agent collaboration and major cleanup integration

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-1402)**
```quote
well discovered. trust the process.
the other agent started well from your work an consolidated successful a major prior cleanup. double check your main changes are present in the new branch state and the just pull.
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect! Trusted the process and verified core changes preserved. Enhanced clean scripts ✅, template 3.1.4.2 ✅, session PDCAs ✅ all present. The other agent successfully consolidated major prior cleanup - brilliant collaborative repository management. Reset completed successfully, trusting proven process wisdom.

**Learning Applied:** Trust the process when user confirms successful agent collaboration - other agents can perform major consolidations that preserve essential work while integrating broader cleanup efforts
