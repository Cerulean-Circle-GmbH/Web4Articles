### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Decision Reporting Correction Approach**
  - a) Review and correct all recent PDCAs that violated decision principle
  - b) Focus on fixing future PDCAs only, leaving previous ones as learning examples
  - c) Create systematic process to identify real vs fake decisions before finalizing PDCAs

- [ ] **Decision 2: User Authority Recognition Implementation**
  - a) Always present multiple options for any technical approach or next steps
  - b) Ask for user guidance on methodology choices and tool selections
  - c) Present decisions when there are genuine alternatives that affect outcomes

- [ ] **Decision 3: Previous PDCA Violation Assessment**
  - a) List and analyze specific instances where I said "all clear" instead of real decisions
  - b) Create correction PDCAs for the most critical violations
  - c) Document patterns of violation to prevent future occurrences

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-1128)**
```quote
you do not yet use nor report the decisions correctly 
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right - I've been violating the "Never 2 1 (TO ONE), Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)" principle by saying "all clear, no decisions" when I should be presenting real choices that need your guidance. I've been making unilateral decisions instead of recognizing your authority over technical approaches and next steps. This is a critical violation that needs immediate correction.

**Learning Applied:** "Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)" means I must present genuine decisions for user collaboration instead of assuming or saying "all clear" - user authority over technical decisions must be respected through real choice presentation

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Correct critical decision reporting violations and implement proper collaborative decision making with user authority recognition

**Requirements Traceability:** Complete adherence to "Never 2 1, Always 4 2" principle for all future decision reporting

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Violation Analysis:** Identify specific instances where I violated the decision principle
- **Decision Pattern Recognition:** Learn to distinguish real decisions from fake "all clear" statements
- **User Authority Integration:** Always present choices for technical approaches, methodologies, and next steps
- **Collaborative Excellence:** Implement systematic approach to identify genuine decisions requiring user input

## **🔧 DO**

**1. Critical Violation Analysis**

**Pattern of Violations Identified:**
```markdown
Recent PDCA Violations:
- "All clear, no decisions to make" - WRONG (multiple instances)
- Marking decisions as [x] completed unilaterally - WRONG
- Not presenting real technical choices - WRONG
- Assuming next steps without user input - WRONG
```

**Specific Examples of "Never 2 1" Violations:**
- **Clean Script PDCA**: Said "all clear" instead of asking about enhancement methodology approach
- **Documentation Learning PDCA**: Marked all decisions completed instead of asking about application approach
- **Template Compliance PDCA**: Said "all clear" instead of asking about future PDCA creation priorities

**2. "Always 4 2" Principle Understanding**

**What I Should Be Doing:**
```markdown
❌ WRONG - "All clear, no decisions to make"
✅ CORRECT - Present real choices that affect outcomes

❌ WRONG - Unilateral technical decisions  
✅ CORRECT - Ask for user guidance on approaches

❌ WRONG - Assume next steps
✅ CORRECT - Present options for what to work on next
```

**User Authority Recognition Categories:**
- **Technical Approaches**: How to implement solutions, which tools to use
- **Methodology Choices**: Which process to follow, how to approach tasks  
- **Priority Decisions**: What to work on next, task order selection
- **Enhancement Strategies**: How to improve existing work, optimization approaches

**3. Real Decision Identification Process**

**Questions to Ask Myself:**
1. Are there multiple valid approaches to this problem?
2. Does the user have preferences about methodology or tools?  
3. What should we prioritize next?
4. How should we handle tradeoffs or alternatives?
5. What level of detail or scope is appropriate?

**Decision Quality Criteria:**
- **Genuine Choice**: Multiple viable options with different outcomes
- **User Authority**: Technical or priority decisions user should make
- **Impact Assessment**: Choices that affect project direction or quality
- **Collaborative Value**: Options that benefit from user expertise and preferences

**4. Collaborative Decision Implementation**

**Current Session Real Decisions:**
The QA Decisions in this PDCA are genuine examples - I need your guidance on:
1. How to handle correcting previous violation instances
2. What approach to take for recognizing user authority  
3. Whether to assess and fix previous PDCAs or focus forward

**Future Decision Pattern:**
- **Before concluding any PDCA**: Ask "What genuine choices need user input?"
- **Technical decisions**: Present methodology options with pros/cons
- **Next steps**: Offer multiple pathways and ask for user preference
- **Enhancement opportunities**: Present improvement options for user selection

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Violation Pattern Confirmed (CRITICAL)**
```
Recent PDCAs reviewed: 3 consecutive violations
"All clear" statements: Multiple instances across all recent work
Unilateral decisions: Marked completed without user input
Decision authority: Consistently violated user technical authority
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"you do not yet use nor report the decisions correctly"**

**Principle Understanding Verified (CORRECTED)**
```
Never 2 1 (TO ONE): ✅ Now understand this means no unilateral decisions
Always 4 2 (FOR TWO): ✅ Now understand this means present real choices
User Authority: ✅ Recognize user decisions over technical approaches
Collaborative Excellence: ✅ Genuine decisions produce better outcomes
```

**Real Decision Quality Assessment (IMPLEMENTED)**
```  
Current PDCA Decisions: ✅ Present 3 genuine choices requiring user input
Decision Categories: ✅ Cover correction approach, authority recognition, assessment method
User Impact: ✅ Each decision affects how violation correction proceeds
Collaborative Value: ✅ User expertise needed to determine best correction approach
```
