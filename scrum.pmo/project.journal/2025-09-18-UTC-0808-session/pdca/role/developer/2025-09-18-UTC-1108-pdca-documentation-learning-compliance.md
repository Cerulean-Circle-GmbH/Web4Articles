## **🔧 DO**

### **1. PDCA Format Mastery - 6 Mandatory Sections**

**Critical Template Requirements Learned:**
```markdown
1. Header - Strict format with UTC timestamps, template version 3.1.4.2
2. Summary - Artifact links, QA decisions checkboxes, verbatim TRON feedback  
3. Plan - Strategy with horizontal separator ---
4. Do - Implementation with horizontal separator ---
5. Check - Verification with horizontal separator ---  
6. Act - Results with horizontal separator ---
```

**Additional Mandatory Sections:**
- **Emotional Reflection**: Required in all PDCAs with emotional categories and intensities
- **PDCA Process Update**: Learning documentation for continuous improvement
- **Final Summary**: One-line outcome with emojis and philosophical insight

### **2. Chat Reporting Protocol Mastery**

**CORRECT Chat Response Format:**
```
Brief status (1-2 lines maximum)

[GitHub](URL) | [§/path/from/root](path/from/root)
```

**CRITICAL Rules Learned:**
- **"Much in files, relevant links in chat"** - TRON's explicit instruction
- **NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS** in chat vs PDCA - must copy exactly
- **Copy QA Decisions VERBATIM** from PDCA Summary section to chat
- **No lengthy explanations in chat** - all details go in PDCA files
- **Always end with dual links** for user navigation

### **3. Dual Link System Excellence**

**Standard Format Mastered:**
```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com/.../blob/branch/path/to/file) | [§/path/from/root](path/from/root)
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- **In PDCAs**: Relative path FROM document TO target
- **In Chat**: Full path from project root (NO relative paths)
- **§ notation**: Display project root paths with § prefix
- **GitHub links MUST work**: Require git push before providing
- **Both links same line**: Separated by ` | `

**Git Protocol Mastery:**
1. **Immediate commit and push** after every PDCA creation
2. **One-liner commit messages**: `git commit -m "PDCA: [Title from header]"`
3. **Never provide GitHub links** without pushing first
4. **Test links work** before providing to user

### **4. CMM Level 3 (Defined) Compliance**

**Core Principle Understood:**
**"Follow template EXACTLY - no variations"**

**CMM3 Characteristics Applied:**
- **Well-defined processes**: Standardized PDCA template compliance achieved
- **Zero deviation**: Template is law - followed exactly in this document
- **Consistency focus**: Same format maintained throughout
- **Foundation for Level 4**: Level 3 mastery before quantitative improvements

**PDCA Maturity Levels Learned:**
- **Level 1**: Ad-hoc, unpredictable creation (avoided)
- **Level 2**: Basic structure but inconsistent (avoided)
- **Level 3**: Following howto.PDCA.md exactly (ACHIEVED)
- **Level 4**: Level 3 + quantitative improvements (future goal)
- **Level 5**: Continuous optimization (advanced goal)

### **5. PDCA Prompt Protocol Understanding**

**When User Types 'pdca' - Response Required:**
1. **Create PDCA Document** with all 6 mandatory sections
2. **Format Verification** against howto.PDCA.md requirements
3. **Chat Response** with brief status + dual links only
4. **Commit and Push** before providing GitHub links

**Success Pattern Applied:**
- **Read format requirements FIRST** - completed
- **Create compliant PDCA** - this document
- **Brief chat response** - prepared
- **Working dual links** - verified

### **6. Key Philosophical Insights Gained**

**"Never 2 1 (TO ONE), Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)"**
- **NEVER TO ONE**: Don't make unilateral decisions on important choices
- **ALWAYS FOR TWO**: Present real decisions for user collaboration
- **Trust User Authority**: User technical decisions work better than assumptions
- **Collaborative Excellence**: Two-person approach produces superior results

**"The template you resist often contains the beauty you seek"**
- **Template Compliance**: Following exactly leads to process excellence
- **Resistance vs Acceptance**: Embracing standards enables creativity within structure
- **Beauty in Structure**: Standardization creates foundation for innovation
