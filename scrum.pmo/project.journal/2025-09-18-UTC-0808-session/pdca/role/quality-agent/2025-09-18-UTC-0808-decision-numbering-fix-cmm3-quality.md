### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - User selected 1d (Quality/Testing Focus), 2d (Quality Agent), 3d (Extended session) - direct action required

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-0808)**
```quote
1d and pdca process improvement
2d
3d

where did you pick up the ridicoulous decision numbering.
pdac cmm3 compliant and quote the wrong location.
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right - I picked up that ridiculous "1. a)" numbering from the merge conflict in the PDCA decision guide (lines 40-45). The guide has conflicting formats and I used the stupid one. Switching to Quality Agent role for CMM3 compliance focus and TaskStateMachine automation work.

**Learning Applied:** Stop using artificial decision numbering complexity, fix process documentation, focus on CMM3 compliance

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Fix decision numbering stupidity, establish CMM3 compliant processes, complete TaskStateMachine automation

**Requirements Traceability:** Sprint 20 Task 33 - TaskStateMachine Web4 compliance and CMM3 automation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Decision Format Fix:** Eliminate ridiculous numbering, use clear direct decisions only
- **CMM3 Compliance:** Establish proper process documentation and automation standards
- **TaskStateMachine Focus:** Complete Web4 compliant TaskStateMachine 0.3.0.4 with IOR removal
- **Process Improvement:** Fix PDCA guide merge conflicts and establish quality standards

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Decision Numbering Problem Analysis**

**Source of Stupidity Identified:**
```markdown
# From scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md lines 40-45:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - a) [First option with rationale]
  - b) [Second option with rationale]
=======
  1. a) [First option with rationale]
  2. b) [Second option with rationale]
>>>>>>> origin/dev/2025-09-14-UTC-1425
```

**Problem:** Merge conflict created ridiculous "1. a)" format that I stupidly adopted

**Solution:** Use simple, direct decisions without artificial numbering complexity

### **2. CMM3 Compliance Requirements**

**CMM Level 3 Characteristics:**
- **Defined Processes:** Well-documented, standardized procedures
- **Process Focus:** Systematic approach to process improvement
- **Organizational Standards:** Consistent practices across all work
- **Quality Assurance:** Built-in quality checks and validation

**PDCA CMM3 Requirements:**
- Consistent template usage (3.1.4.2)
- Proper artifact linking with dual GitHub/local paths
- Systematic decision documentation
- Process improvement tracking

### **3. TaskStateMachine Analysis**

**Current Status Check:**
```bash
# Check TaskStateMachine current state
ls -la components/TaskStateMachine/
# Check for 0.3.0.4 version and IOR dependencies
```

**Web4 Compliance Requirements:**
- Remove IOR dependencies (build issues mentioned)
- Implement empty constructor pattern
- Ensure TypeScript-only implementation
- Follow Web4 radical OOP principles
