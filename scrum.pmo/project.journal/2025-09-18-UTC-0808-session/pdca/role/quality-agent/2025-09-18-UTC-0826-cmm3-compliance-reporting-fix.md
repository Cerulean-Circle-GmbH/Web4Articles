### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: CMM3 Process Compliance Level**
  - a) Level 2 (Managed) - Basic process documentation only
  - b) Level 3 (Defined) - Systematic PDCA for all user prompts with dual links
  - c) Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed) - Metrics-driven process improvement

- [ ] **Decision 2: Reporting Format Correction**
  - a) Short chat responses with PDCA reference links only
  - b) No chat content - redirect to PDCA document immediately
  - c) Minimal chat with exact PDCA decision copy

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-0808)**
```quote
2 and 4
CMM3 for the PDCA process.
your reporting is completley incompliant.
long chat response, no dual links no pdca!
bad decision format!
```

### **My Answer**
Process violation acknowledged - created PDCA for compliance fix. Selected options 2 (Level 3 Defined) and 4 (Quantitatively Managed) for CMM3 PDCA process.

**Learning Applied:** Must create PDCA for every user prompt, use dual links, present proper decisions, avoid long chat responses

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish CMM3 Level 3 systematic PDCA process compliance

**Requirements Traceability:** CMM3 process maturity for systematic quality

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Process Compliance:** PDCA for every user prompt without exception
- **Dual Link Standard:** [GitHub](url) | [§/path](path) format mandatory
- **Decision Format:** Proper decision structure with clear options
- **Chat Discipline:** Short responses with PDCA links only

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Process Violations Identified**

**Critical Violations:**
- ❌ **No PDCA:** Failed to create PDCA for user prompt "2 and 4 CMM3..."
- ❌ **No Dual Links:** Chat response lacked [GitHub](url) | [§/path](path) format
- ❌ **Bad Decisions:** No proper decision structure presented
- ❌ **Long Chat:** Verbose response instead of PDCA reference
- ❌ **CMM3 Non-compliance:** Failed systematic process requirements

### **2. CMM3 Level 3 Requirements**

**Defined Process Characteristics:**
- Systematic PDCA creation for all user interactions
- Standardized dual linking format
- Proper decision structure with clear options
- Short chat responses with PDCA references
- Process documentation and compliance tracking

### **3. Compliance Correction Implementation**

**New Process Standard:**
```markdown
1. User prompt → Immediate PDCA creation
2. All artifacts → Dual link format [GitHub](url) | [§/path](path)
3. Decisions → Proper structure with clear options
4. Chat → Short response with PDCA link only
5. Documentation → Systematic process tracking
```
