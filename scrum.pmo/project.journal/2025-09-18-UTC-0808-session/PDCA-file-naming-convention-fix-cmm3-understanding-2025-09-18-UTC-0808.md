### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - User selected 1b (Level 3 Defined) and clarified 2a/b/c are not real choices but reporting format explanation

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-18-UTC-0808)**
```quote
1b read understanding cmm3 
2 a and b and c...this is not a decision or choice.
so b means all you want to put into the chat other than c goes into the pdca document.

read the howto.pdca. not he essentials. the pdca file naming convention is totally wrong.

explain the correct one and fix the names with 
git mv
and keep the links corrected.
```

### **My Answer**
Selected 1b (CMM3 Level 3 Defined). Understanding 2a/b/c clarification - not real decisions, just reporting format explanation. Reading howto.PDCA for correct naming convention and will fix with git mv operations.

**Learning Applied:** PDCA file naming convention violations need correction, CMM3 Level 3 systematic processes required

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Fix PDCA file naming convention and establish CMM3 Level 3 understanding

**Requirements Traceability:** Process compliance and systematic naming standards

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Read CMM3 Understanding:** Study PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md for Level 3 requirements
- **Read PDCA Guide:** Study howto.PDCA.md for correct naming convention
- **Identify Violations:** Find all incorrectly named PDCA files
- **Fix with Git MV:** Rename files maintaining link integrity

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. CMM3 Level 3 Understanding**

**CMM3 Level 3 (Defined) Requirements:**
- Systematic processes documented and standardized
- Process compliance tracking and measurement
- Well-defined procedures followed consistently
- Quality assurance built into processes
- Continuous process improvement

### **2. PDCA File Naming Convention Analysis**

**Current Violations Identified:**
```
❌ WRONG: PDCA-session-startup-background-agent-initialization-2025-09-18-UTC-0808.md
❌ WRONG: PDCA-decision-numbering-fix-cmm3-quality-focus-2025-09-18-UTC-0808.md
❌ WRONG: PDCA-branch-merge-dev-agent-coordination-2025-09-18-UTC-0808.md
❌ WRONG: PDCA-cmm3-compliance-reporting-fix-2025-09-18-UTC-0808.md
```

**Correct Convention (from howto.PDCA.md lines 271-284):**
```
✅ CORRECT: YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM-descriptive-title.md
✅ Format: Timestamp prefix for chronological ordering
✅ Location: scrum.pmo/project.journal/session/pdca/role/[role]/
✅ Example: 2025-09-18-UTC-0808-session-startup-background-agent.md
```

**Key Rules:**
- Timestamp FIRST for chronological ordering
- Descriptive title AFTER timestamp
- NO "PDCA-" prefix in filename
- Role-based organization in subdirectories

### **3. File Renaming Implementation**

**Git MV Operations Required:**
