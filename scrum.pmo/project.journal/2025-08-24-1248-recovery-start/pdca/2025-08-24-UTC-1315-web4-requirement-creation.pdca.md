### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - User provided clear direction to create condensed requirement from sprint-20

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-1308)**
```quote
read the po role and how to create requiremen.md

then read https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/dev/2025-08-24-UTC-1248/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20 and create a web4.requirement.md in sprint 20 from it as a condensed for of what you learn from the referenced doc that is different from your mainstream programming and architecture approach
```

### **My Answer**
I'll read the PO role documentation to understand requirement creation, then analyze sprint-20 to extract the Web4 paradigm shifts that differ from mainstream approaches and create a condensed requirement document.

**Learning Applied:** Focus on paradigm shifts and revolutionary concepts, not incremental improvements

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Analysis Objectives:**
1. Understand PO role and requirement.md format
2. Analyze sprint-20 for Web4 revolutionary concepts
3. Extract paradigm shifts from mainstream programming
4. Create condensed requirement focusing on differences
5. Use proper UUID format for requirements

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear documentation of Web4 paradigm shifts
- Requirement format following PO process guidelines
- Focus on revolutionary differences, not similarities
- Proper traceability with UUIDs

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Analyzed PO Process Documentation**
- Requirement format uses `[requirement:uuid:<uuidv4>]` tags
- Requirements should have clear acceptance criteria
- Must link back to planning.md
- Focus on WHY/WHAT/HOW structure

### **2. Studied Sprint-20 Documentation**
Key findings from sprint-20:
- TLA (The Last Architecture) = MDAv4 + EAMv4 + SOAv4 based on Web4
- Revolutionary "42" answer to architecture
- ONCE kernel foundation ("ONCE and FOR ALL")
- MDA sphere architecture with poles and equator
- Semantic invariants ending format wars

### **3. Identified 10 Core Paradigm Shifts**
1. **Empty Constructor Principle** - NO initialization parameters
2. **Scenario-First Development** - Objects as hibernatable scenarios
3. **IOR Architecture** - Interoperable Object References
4. **Semantic Invariants** - Format wars become irrelevant
5. **MDA Sphere Architecture** - Not flat layers but bounded sphere
6. **Git Transaction Chains** - Business processes with rollback
7. **ONCE Kernel** - Universal communication engine
8. **6-Hop Traceability** - Fixed graph from prose to units
9. **Radical OOP** - NO functions outside classes
10. **The 42 Answer** - Architectural singularity achieved

### **4. Created web4.requirement.md**
- Structured with proper requirement UUIDs
- Focused on differences from mainstream
- Included revolutionary insights section
- Added implementation requirements
- Linked to source documents

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Requirement Format (VERIFIED)**
- ✅ Uses `[requirement:uuid:xxx]` format
- ✅ Has checkboxes for tracking
- ✅ Links back to planning.md
- ✅ Includes acceptance criteria

**Content Focus (VERIFIED)**
- ✅ Emphasizes paradigm shifts, not incremental changes
- ✅ Contrasts Web4 vs Mainstream approaches
- ✅ Captures revolutionary nature of TLA
- ✅ Documents "42" architectural answer concept

**Key Paradigm Shifts Documented (VERIFIED)**
- ✅ Empty constructors (fundamental difference)
- ✅ Scenario-based objects (not runtime entities)
- ✅ Semantic invariants (ends format wars)
- ✅ MDA sphere (not flat layers)
- ✅ Git transactions (not database ACID)

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"create a web4.requirement.md in sprint 20 from it as a condensed for of what you learn from the referenced doc that is different from your mainstream programming and architecture approach"**

✅ Created condensed requirement focusing specifically on differences from mainstream approaches

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Next Steps:**
1. Commit and push the new requirement document
2. Continue with additional user instructions

### **Key Insights Captured:**
- Web4 is NOT an evolution but a revolution
- TLA represents architectural singularity
- Empty constructors enable universal serialization
- Semantic invariants make formats irrelevant
- ONCE kernel provides universal communication

### **Documentation Value:**
The web4.requirement.md now serves as a condensed reference for understanding how Web4 fundamentally differs from mainstream programming paradigms. It captures the revolutionary nature of TLA as "The Last Architecture" - the final answer to information system design.
