# Project State — 2025-08-11 09:55 UTC

**Status:** Recovered from main branch README, understanding project structure and preparing branch overview.

### Recovery Context
- **Trigger:** User requested recovery from README on main branch
- **Branch:** main (synced with origin/main - 51 commits fast-forwarded)
- **Action:** Full recovery procedure following README.md guidelines

### Project Understanding (from README.md)
- **Purpose:** Create a md-file based WIKI for CIRAS Project articles
- **Management:** AI-driven CMMI Level 4 SCRUM implementation
- **Tech Stack:**
  - Strict TypeScript and ESM only (no CommonJS)
  - Vitest for testing (Jest forbidden)
  - Radical OOP (no functions outside classes)
  - Each article/tool as separate git submodule
  - Shell scripts and TypeScript backends in separate files

### Key Principles Identified
- DRY Principle strictly enforced
- All file operations via shell for traceability
- CLI commands use positional arguments only (no shell-style options)
- Separation of concerns between shell and TypeScript
- Full documentation and traceability requirements

### Current Tools
- **obash:** Project-scoped Bash environment with completion
- **TSRanger:** Interactive TUI for method discovery (Sprint 2)
- **tssh:** TypeScript shell wrapper with completion support

### Environment Status
- Node.js version: (to be verified)
- Docker: (to be verified)
- PlantUML/Graphviz: (to be verified)
- Devcontainer: Planned for Sprint 4

### Next Steps
1. ✓ Recovery from main branch README completed
2. Create comprehensive branch overview with categorization
3. Verify environment prerequisites
4. Review recent sprint activities and task status

### Recovery Actions Taken
- Switched to main branch
- Updated from origin/main (51 commits)
- Read and analyzed README.md
- Created recovery journal entry
- Identified project principles and current state
