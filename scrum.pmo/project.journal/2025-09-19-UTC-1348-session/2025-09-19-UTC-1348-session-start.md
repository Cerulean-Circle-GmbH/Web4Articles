### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Startup Sequence Complete**: Git config, safety guidelines, environment sourcing, PDCA framework initialization
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) **Technical Development Focus** - Component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development using TypeScript/ESM/Vitest stack
  - b) **Architecture Focus** - System design improvements, process optimization, integration work with Web4 tools
  - c) **Documentation Focus** - PDCA automation, workflow optimization, requirement processing and validation
  - d) **Quality/Testing Focus** - Vitest testing strategies, validation frameworks, compliance with tech stack constraints

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) **Background Agent** for autonomous development coordination and process management
  - b) **Switch to Developer** for direct component implementation and feature development
  - c) **Switch to Architect** for system design, tool integration, and process improvements
  - d) **Switch to Tester** for quality assurance, Vitest implementation, and validation frameworks
  - e) **Switch to Product Owner** for requirement analysis and user story development

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) **Full day session** with multiple PDCA cycles covering comprehensive development work
  - b) **Half-day focused session** on specific component or feature development
  - c) **Quick analysis session** for current project state review and immediate priorities
  - d) **Extended multi-day session** for major feature development or architectural improvements

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Complete background agent startup sequence and establish collaborative work direction

**Key Requirements:**
1. ✅ Git configuration (pull.rebase false) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Read agent safety guidelines - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ Environment sourcing (source.env) - COMPLETED
4. ✅ PDCA framework initialization - COMPLETED
5. ✅ Tech stack understanding (Vitest/ESM/TypeScript) - COMPLETED
6. ✅ Session directory creation - COMPLETED
7. ✅ Dev branch establishment - COMPLETED
8. 🔄 Present startup decision framework - IN PROGRESS

**Golden Rule Application:** "Don't teach others what you don't understand yourself" - All documentation read and understood before proceeding with guidance.

**Technical Constraints Identified:**
- Vitest mandatory for all testing (Jest banned)
- ESM-native, TypeScript-first development
- Docker/Devcontainer environment
- Non-interactive command requirements for background agents

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Startup Sequence Execution:**

1. **Git Safety Configuration** ✅
   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase false
   ```
   - Prevents rebase conflicts in collaborative environment
   - Critical for background agent safety

2. **Safety Guidelines Review** ✅
   - Read: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
   - Key learning: Background agents cannot handle interactive prompts
   - Must use non-interactive flags: `--yes`, `-y`, `--no-edit`

3. **Git Process Cleanup** ✅
   ```bash
   sleep 30 && pkill -f "git" 2>/dev/null || true &
   ```
   - Background process to clean defunct git processes
   - Prevents system resource drain

4. **Environment Initialization** ✅
   ```bash
   source source.env
   ```
   - Web4 tools now available in PATH
   - Scripts/ and scripts/versions/ directories accessible

5. **PDCA Framework Setup** ✅
   - Documentation already available in scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
   - Essential guide and decision framework reviewed
   - Template version 3.1.4.2 confirmed

6. **Tech Stack Validation** ✅
   - Vitest confirmed as mandatory testing framework
   - Jest explicitly banned due to poor ESM support
   - TypeScript-first, ESM-native development confirmed

7. **Session Infrastructure** ✅
   - Session directory: `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-19-UTC-1348-session/`
   - Dev branch: `dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1348`
   - Project status file created

8. **Decision Framework Presentation** 🔄
   - Standard 3-question startup framework implemented
   - User authority preserved for work direction choices
   - Clear options with distinct outcomes provided
