### **My Answer**
**Session initialized successfully!** ✅

Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1356 branch, installed git automation, reviewed PDCA guidelines, and prepared session start PDCA with startup decision framework. Ready to proceed based on your selected focus area and role preference.

**Learning Applied:** Following the complete startup procedure ensures proper PDCA framework establishment and user decision clarity.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Startup Procedure Implementation:**
1. ✅ Check PDCA documentation exists (confirmed present)
2. ✅ Create dev/[UTC timestamp] branch (dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1356)
3. ✅ Install git post-commit hook for auto-merge functionality
4. ✅ Read PDCA guidelines and startup decision framework
5. ✅ Create session start PDCA with three mandatory decisions
6. 🔄 Present decisions to user for work direction establishment

**Expected Outcomes:**
- User responds with decision selections (e.g., "1a, 2b, 3b")
- Clear work direction established based on user priorities
- Proper branch structure and automation in place
- PDCA process active for session tracking

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Branch Management:**
- Started on cursor/start-background-process-c635
- Created and switched to dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1356
- Configured remote tracking for new branch

**Git Automation Setup:**
```bash
# Created post-commit hook for auto-merge
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Documentation Review:**
- Read howto.PDCA.md (23,303 bytes) - Complete 6-section format requirements
- Read PDCA.howto.decide.md - Startup decision framework and 42 principle
- Reviewed recovery/start-command.md - Background agent operating procedures

**PDCA Creation:**
- Created session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-1356-session/
- Implemented mandatory 6-section format with horizontal separators
- Applied startup decision framework with three standard categories
- Prepared dual link format for GitHub integration
