## **🚀 DO**

### **Executed Actions**

1. **PDCA Documentation Check**
   ```bash
   ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
   # ✅ Confirmed: Documentation exists and is current
   ```

2. **Branch Management**
   ```bash
   # Started on: cursor/start-background-process-c4c1
   # Created: dev/2025-09-06-UTC-0747
   # Status: Working on proper development branch
   ```

3. **Git Automation Installation**
   ```bash
   # Created .git/hooks/post-commit with auto-merge functionality
   # Made executable with chmod +x
   # Ready for automatic merge to release/dev when on save/start branch
   ```

4. **Session Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-06-UTC-0747-session
   # Created proper session directory for documentation
   ```

5. **Guidelines Review**
   - Read howto.PDCA.md focusing on 6 mandatory sections
   - Reviewed PDCA.howto.decide.md for decision framework
   - Applied startup decision framework with 3 standard questions

### **Technical Implementation**
- Background Agent properly identified (not Scrum Master or other roles)
- Branch management following cursor/* → dev/timestamp pattern
- PDCA format compliance with all required sections
- Dual links preparation (GitHub | local)
- Numbered decisions for easy user response
