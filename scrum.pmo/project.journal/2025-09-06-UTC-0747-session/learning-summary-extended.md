1. **Always on save/start** - PM role maintains project continuity and oversight
2. **Document everything** - Including project management decisions, requirement mappings, and oversight frameworks
3. **Fix when asked** - Apply PM role systematic improvement approaches and user guidance
4. **Share knowledge** - PM insights benefit all roles, future sprint planning, and systematic development

### **Quality Standards - Multi-Role Integration**
- Every PDCA follows 6-section format with TRON feedback integration and horizontal separators
- Dual links always work with proper GitHub | local format and Â§ notation
- QA Decisions copied exactly from PDCA to chat (CRITICAL - never create different ones)
- Requirements mapped systematically to sprint tasks with existing repository analysis first
- PM oversight framework applied to all significant work with PDCA methodology
- User feedback quoted verbatim with UTC timestamps
- Git pull after every commit after every PDCA after every prompt

### **Decision-Making Excellence**
- **USER Authority**: All QA decisions made by user, agents present options only
- **Real Choices Only**: Present genuine alternatives with different outcomes and rationale
- **Risk Assessment**: Warn about destructive operations and significant impacts
- **Chat Compliance**: Exact PDCA decision copying, never paraphrase or modify
- **The 42 Rule**: When ambiguous, ASK the user - the answer is often another question

### **Web4 Architecture - PM Enhanced**
