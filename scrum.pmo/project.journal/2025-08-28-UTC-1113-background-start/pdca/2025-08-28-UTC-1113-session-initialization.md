- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for general coordination and analysis
  - b) Switch to Developer for hands-on component implementation
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and architectural improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and test development
  - e) Switch to ScrumMaster for process and sprint management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple PDCA cycles for comprehensive work
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component or feature
  - c) Quick analysis session to review current project state
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major development effort

### **My Answer**
Starting fresh background agent session! I've initialized the project journal structure and created this startup PDCA with the standard 3-decision framework. Ready to begin work based on your direction for focus area, role, and session planning.

**Learning Applied:** Using the standardized startup decision framework ensures clear direction and proper role alignment from session beginning.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Initialize background agent session with proper structure and decision framework

**Requirements Traceability:** Session initialization following established PDCA protocols

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Session Setup:** Create project journal directory structure for new work session
- **Decision Framework:** Apply standard 3-decision startup template for clear direction
- **Git Integration:** Start from main branch reset to save/start.v4 as per project convention

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Git Branch Setup**
```bash
# Switched to main branch
git checkout main
# Reset to latest save/start version
git reset --hard origin/save/start.v4
# Confirmed at commit 7bccef0
```

**2. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
# Created timestamp-based session directory
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1113-background-start/pdca
```

**3. PDCA Template Application**
- Loaded official template from `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md`
- Applied startup decision framework from `PDCA.howto.decide.md`
- Incorporated all mandatory sections including emotional reflection and process update

**4. Decision Categories Established**
- **Focus Area:** Technical vs Architecture vs Documentation vs Quality paths
- **Role Selection:** Appropriate agent role for chosen work focus
- **Session Planning:** Duration and sprint cycle expectations
