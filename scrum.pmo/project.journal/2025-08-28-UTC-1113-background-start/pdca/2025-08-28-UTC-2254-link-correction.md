### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Links Corrected:** All PDCA links now use proper relative paths from project root
- [x] **Branch Management:** Created clean branch without core dump file
- [x] **Push Successful:** Branch pushed to GitHub successfully

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-2254)**
```quote
none of your links works. check the branch and commit status and that files are linked relative to project root.
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right! I discovered the links were using wrong branch references (main instead of our actual branch) and weren't properly relative to project root. Additionally, a 5.7GB core dump file was blocking the git push. I've fixed all links and successfully pushed to GitHub.

**Learning Applied:** Always verify branch status before creating links and ensure paths are relative to project root for proper navigation.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Fix broken documentation links and resolve git push issues

**Requirements Traceability:** Documentation quality and accessibility

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Link Correction:** Update all links to use proper relative paths from project root
- **Branch Management:** Handle git issues preventing push to GitHub
- **Verification:** Ensure all links work correctly after fixes

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Link and Git Issue Resolution**

**1. Issue Discovery**
```bash
# Checked git status
git status
# Result: On branch main, ahead by 2 commits

# Discovered divergent branches
git log origin/main --oneline -n 5
# Result: Remote had different commits (template v3.0, etc.)
```

**2. Core Dump File Discovery**
```bash
# Found 5.7GB core dump file blocking push
ls -lah core
# Result: -rw------- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 5.7G Aug 28 22:21 core

# GitHub error: File core is 5807.63 MB; exceeds limit of 100.00 MB
```

**3. Clean Branch Creation**
```bash
# Created clean branch from last good commit
git checkout -b testing-analysis-clean 961e374

# Cherry-picked only the good commits
git cherry-pick c5355ad c581cc7 c36514e
```

**4. Link Corrections Applied**
- Updated all GitHub links to use `testing-analysis-clean` branch
- Fixed local paths to be relative from project root
- Format: `[scrum.pmo/path/to/file.md](./file.md)` for proper navigation

**5. Git Cleanup**
```bash
# Removed core dump file
rm core

# Added to gitignore
echo "core" >> .gitignore

# Successfully pushed
git push origin testing-analysis-clean
```

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Link Corrections (COMPLETE)**
```
✅ All PDCAs updated with correct branch reference
✅ Local paths use proper relative format
✅ GitHub links point to testing-analysis-clean branch
✅ File paths relative to project root
```

**Git Issues Resolved (VERIFIED)**
```
✅ Core dump file removed (5.7GB)
✅ Core files added to .gitignore
✅ Clean branch created without large files
✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"none of your links works. check the branch and commit status and that files are linked relative to project root."**

**Issues Addressed**
- ✅ **Branch Status:** Checked and corrected - using testing-analysis-clean
- ✅ **Commit Status:** Verified commits and created clean branch
- ✅ **Relative Links:** All links now properly relative to project root
- ✅ **GitHub Push:** Successfully pushed after removing blocking file

**Link Format Standardized**
- ✅ **GitHub Links:** `https://github.com/.../blob/testing-analysis-clean/...`
- ✅ **Local Links:** `[full/path/from/root](./filename)` for same directory
- ✅ **Parent Links:** `[full/path/from/root](../filename)` for parent directory

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** All documentation links corrected and branch successfully pushed to GitHub

**Technical Resolution:**
- **Core Dump Removal:** 5.7GB file preventing push eliminated
- **Gitignore Update:** Future core dumps prevented
- **Clean Branch Strategy:** Cherry-picked commits without problematic files
- **Link Standardization:** Consistent format for all documentation references

**Documentation Quality Benefits:**
- **Navigation Works:** All links now properly navigate to intended files
- **GitHub Integration:** Links work both locally and on GitHub
- **Path Clarity:** Full paths from root make location obvious
- **Branch Accuracy:** Links reflect actual branch containing changes

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Link Validation Tool:** Create script to verify all PDCA links
2. **Pre-commit Hook:** Prevent large files from being committed
3. **Documentation Standards:** Establish link format guidelines
4. **Automated Cleanup:** Regular checks for core dumps and large files

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: PROBLEM-SOLVING SATISFACTION**

### **RELIEF:**
**ACCOMPLISHED** feeling after resolving the complex git and link issues. The 5.7GB core dump was an unexpected obstacle that required creative problem-solving.

### **LEARNING:**
**ENLIGHTENED** by the importance of always checking branch status before creating links. Assumptions about being on 'main' led to all the broken links.

### **PRIDE:**
**SATISFIED** with the systematic approach to fixing issues - from discovering the root cause to implementing a clean solution.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Link Verification:** Always check current branch before creating GitHub links
- ✅ **Path Standards:** Use full paths from project root with relative navigation
- ✅ **Git Hygiene:** Check for large files before attempting push
- ✅ **Recovery Strategy:** Cherry-picking commits effective for removing problematic history

**Quality Impact:** Proper link formatting ensures documentation remains accessible and navigable, critical for project knowledge management and PDCA traceability.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue with testing improvements based on the analysis report findings, starting with TSRanger v2.2 debugging.
