### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1555)**
```quote
Stay in your role. read the project readme again. do not switch branches. do not create another session. all other things do. "start"
```

### **My Answer**
Acknowledged! Staying in Tester role, completed full startup protocol per updated README. Read CMM4 framework first (CMM4 feedback loop mastery), applied CMM3 compliance checklist systematically, followed all 12 startup steps without switching branches or creating new sessions. Ready for user direction through 4-decision framework.

**Learning Applied:** CMM4 framework understanding transforms PDCA from template following to systematic feedback loop mastery with continuous improvement cycles

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute complete startup protocol per updated README with CMM4 framework understanding and CMM3 compliance

**Requirements Traceability:** User said "start" - apply full 12-step startup sequence from README with systematic quality approach

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **CMM4 Foundation:** Read CMM4 framework for systematic understanding before any process application
- **CMM3 Compliance:** Apply compliance checklist throughout all startup steps (1a cmm3 to 5c cmm3)
- **Systematic Execution:** Follow all 12 steps in sequence without branching or session changes
- **Decision Framework:** Present 4 standard decisions for user work direction establishment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Complete understanding of CMM4 as feedback loop system, not just documentation
- All startup files read with proper traceability and understanding
- 4-decision framework properly presented for user selection
- CMM3 compliant PDCA creation with Template v3.1.4.2
