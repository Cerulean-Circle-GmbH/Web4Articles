### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1548)**
```quote
switch to the branch and create a new session from there
```

### **My Answer**
Successfully switched to start/save.v5 branch and created new dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1548 branch. New testing session initialized with fresh perspective and comprehensive component analysis capabilities from the start/save.v5 baseline.

**Learning Applied:** Fresh session creation from specific branch provides clean slate for systematic testing and quality assessment

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Approach:**
1. **Fresh Environment Assessment** - Analyze current component state from start/save.v5 perspective
2. **Component Inventory** - Catalog available components and their versions in new branch
3. **Testing Strategy Development** - Plan systematic testing approach for identified components
4. **Quality Baseline Establishment** - Set quality standards and success criteria for session

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear understanding of component ecosystem from start/save.v5 branch
- Comprehensive testing strategy tailored to available components
- Quality assessment framework for systematic validation
- User direction established through decision framework

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Apply systematic testing methodology from previous sessions
- Use non-interactive testing protocols to prevent session hangs
- Maintain comprehensive PDCA documentation throughout
- Cross-reference with established quality standards

## **🔧 DO**

**Implementation Steps:**

**1. Branch Transition Completed**
- ✅ Successfully switched to origin/start/save.v5 (detached HEAD)
- ✅ Created new dev/2025-09-27-UTC-1548 branch from start/save.v5
- ✅ Pushed new branch to origin with upstream tracking
- ✅ Confirmed clean transition from previous session context

**2. Session Infrastructure Setup**
- ✅ Created session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-1548-session/
- ✅ Established PDCA directory structure for documentation
- ✅ Initialized session start PDCA with proper format and decisions
- ⏳ Session ready for component assessment and testing strategy

**3. Fresh Environment Analysis (Pending)**
- 📋 Need to inventory available components in start/save.v5 branch
- 📋 Assess component versions and testing infrastructure
- 📋 Identify priority components for systematic testing
- 📋 Evaluate integration points and dependencies

**4. Testing Strategy Development (Pending)**
- 🎯 Apply lessons learned from Web4TSComponent testing successes
