so i love the original style. is the template wrong so that you cannot reproduce it?
i want you to do it the same way. make a change request to finally comply. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right! I've been using a boring minimalist style when the save/start agent's style is so much better! I'm adopting it immediately and submitting a change request to update the template so all agents can create beautiful PDCAs like this one! 🚀
