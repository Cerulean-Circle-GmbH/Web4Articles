# PDCA Entry: CMM 4 Compliance - Following Defined Processes

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Return to CMM 4 compliance by following defined chat reporting processes  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** Fell to CMM 2 with emotional emoji-blasting instead of following howto.PDCA.md  
**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-cmm4-compliance/pdca-cmm4-compliance.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - Returning to defined processes

**User Feedback:** "does the howto pdca tell you to do a full emotional emoji blasting summary or what does it say about reporting in the chat‚Ä¶ cmm 4 meand follow cmm 3 definitions and report improvements. not fall bach to impulsive cmm 2 new hallucinations or inventions"

## Plan

1. **Check howto.PDCA.md** - What it actually says about chat reporting
2. **Identify deviation** - Where I went wrong
3. **Document findings** - Clear understanding
4. **Return to compliance** - Follow defined process
5. **Report properly** - No inventions

## Do

### 1. What howto.PDCA.md Says About Chat Reporting

**Critical Section Found:**
```markdown
## **üö® CRITICAL: CHAT REPORTING ACCURACY**

**NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS IN CHAT!**
- The QA Decisions shown in chat MUST be EXACTLY what's in the PDCA
- Copy-paste the exact decisions from the PDCA Summary section
```

**After Creating PDCA Checklist:**
- Provide dual links in chat response
- Copy QA Decisions EXACTLY from PDCA to chat
- Never skip dual links

**What it does NOT say:**
- Create emotional emoji summaries
- Add personality to chat responses
- Invent new summary formats

### 2. My Deviation from CMM 4

**What I did (CMM 2 - Impulsive):**
```
## **üåü Summary:**
### **‚ú® Style Transformation Complete! üé®üöÄ**
I've fully embraced the beautiful PDCA style! üéâ
```

**What I should have done (CMM 4 - Defined Process):**
```
## Summary:
Created PDCA using save/start style format and submitted change request for template update.
```

### 3. CMM Level Analysis

**CMM 2 (Repeatable but Impulsive):**
- Made up new chat format
- Added emotional content not in PDCA
- Created "hallucinations" beyond requirements

**CMM 3 (Defined):**
- Clear process exists in howto.PDCA.md
- Specific requirements for chat reporting

**CMM 4 (Managed):**
- Follow the defined process
- Report improvements to process
- Stay within boundaries

## Check

‚úÖ howto.PDCA.md checked - clear requirements found  
‚úÖ Deviation identified - emotional summary invented  
‚úÖ CMM levels understood - fell from 4 to 2  
‚ùå Chat reporting compliance - failed to follow process  
‚úÖ User correction received - clear guidance provided  

**Key Finding:** The emotional style belongs IN the PDCA, not in chat summaries

## Act

### Correct Chat Reporting Process:

1. **PDCA Entry**: [Dual links]
2. **QA Decisions**: [Exact copy from PDCA]
3. **Summary**: Brief factual statement of what was done
4. No emotional additions or inventions

### Process Improvement Identified:

The save/start style guide should clarify:
- Beautiful style for PDCA documents ‚úì
- Simple compliance for chat responses ‚úì
- Clear boundary between documentation and reporting

### Going Forward:
- PDCAs can have personality and emotion
- Chat responses must follow howto.PDCA.md exactly
- No inventions or "improvements" to defined process
- Report actual improvements through change requests
