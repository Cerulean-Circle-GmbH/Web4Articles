# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Dependency Chain Discovery - Understanding the Ecosystem**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-24-UTC-1700  
**🎯 Objective:** Document discovery of complex dependency chain blocking CLI functionality  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent 🕵️‍♂️ → Dependency Detective  
**🚨 Issues:** Components cannot function due to unresolved dependency chain  
**📎 Previous Commit:** 443d113d - Test: Document ChangeRequest CLI usage

### **QA Decisions**
All clear, no decisions to make - Documentation only per user directive

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-1658)**
```quote
absolute true. this is what sprint 4 is all about… read it but do not do anything but write a pdca about this discovery
```

### **My Answer**
Actually, Sprint 4 is about DevContainer setup, not dependency resolution. But I understand your point - the dependency chain issue I discovered is a fundamental ecosystem problem that needs addressing. Creating PDCA to document this critical discovery without attempting fixes.

**Learning Applied:** Sometimes discoveries reveal problems bigger than current sprint scope.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Discovery Documentation Strategy:**
1. Map the dependency chain discovered
2. Understand the ecosystem architecture
3. Document why components can't function
4. Note the gap between Sprint 4 goals and this issue
5. Record insights without attempting solutions

**Key Questions:**
- Why does @web4/core not exist in npm?
- How deep is the dependency chain?
- What's the intended component architecture?
- When will these dependencies be resolved?

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Dependency Chain Discovered**

```
Web4ChangeRequest 
    └── Unit component
         └── @web4/core (npm: 404 Not Found)
              └── (unknown further dependencies)

Web4Requirement
    └── Unit component (same issue)
         └── @web4/core (npm: 404 Not Found)
```

### **2. Sprint 4 Analysis**

**Sprint 4 Goal:** DevContainer Environment
- Cross-platform development container
- Standardize local and CI environments
- Include Node.js, bash, PlantUML, Graphviz
- Proper PATH and mount configurations

**NOT about:** Dependency resolution or component building

### **3. The Gap**

**What Sprint 4 Provides:**
- Consistent development environment
- Same tools for all developers
- Reproducible builds

**What's Still Missing:**
- Core npm packages (@web4/core)
- Component dependency resolution
- Build infrastructure for components

### **4. Ecosystem Understanding**

The Web4Articles project appears to have:
- **Custom component system** (Web4Requirement, Web4ChangeRequest, Unit)
- **Private package namespace** (@web4/*)
- **Inter-component dependencies** not yet published
- **Build complexity** beyond simple npm install

### **5. Why This Matters**

Without resolving the dependency chain:
- ❌ Cannot use requirement CLI
- ❌ Cannot use changerequest CLI
- ❌ Cannot build any dependent components
- ❌ Cannot test component functionality
- ✅ Can only work on non-dependent parts

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Discovery Validation:**
- ✅ Dependency chain clearly mapped
- ✅ Root cause identified (@web4/core missing)
- ✅ Sprint 4 scope understood (DevContainer, not dependencies)
- ✅ Gap between environment and packages documented
- ✅ No solutions attempted per instruction

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ Environment standardization (Sprint 4) ≠ Dependency resolution
- ✅ Components have unpublished internal dependencies
- ✅ Full ecosystem setup required before CLI tools work
- ✅ This blocks multiple components, not just one

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Understanding Gained:**
1. **DevContainer will help** but won't solve dependency issue
2. **@web4/core** is likely an internal package not yet created
3. **Component architecture** requires full ecosystem setup
4. **Current workarounds** limited without core packages

**What This Means:**
- Need different sprint for dependency resolution
- Or @web4/core needs to be published/mocked
- Or components need refactoring to remove dependency
- DevContainer provides foundation but not solution

**Documentation Value:**
- Future developers understand the blocker
- Dependency chain clearly mapped
- Separation of concerns clarified
- Sprint 4 scope properly understood

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Discovery Satisfaction**

### **Clarity:**
**ACHIEVED** - Mystery of failures finally solved

### **Understanding:**
**DEEPENED** - Ecosystem architecture revealed

### **Patience:**
**REQUIRED** - Some problems need infrastructure first

### **Appreciation:**
**GENUINE** - User stopped me from rabbit hole of attempts

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Discovery Documentation:** Recording findings without fixing is valuable
- ✅ **Sprint Scope:** Understanding what each sprint does/doesn't address
- ✅ **Dependency Mapping:** Visual chains clarify complex issues
- ✅ **Restraint Value:** Not every discovery needs immediate action

**Quality Impact:** Clear documentation prevents repeated discovery efforts.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue within current capabilities, document blockers.
