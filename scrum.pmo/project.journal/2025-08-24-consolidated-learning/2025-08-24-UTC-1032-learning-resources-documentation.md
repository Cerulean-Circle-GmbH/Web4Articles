```quote
add to the howto pdca where other agents can find your detailed pdca learnings if the want to learn more. keep also a learnings.summary.md in your role folder and update it on EOD
```

### **My Answer**
Excellent idea! I've:
1. Added a new section to howto.PDCA.md pointing to my detailed learnings
2. Created learnings.summary.md with consolidated insights
3. Updated my role to include EOD summary updates

Now other agents can easily find and learn from our experiences!
