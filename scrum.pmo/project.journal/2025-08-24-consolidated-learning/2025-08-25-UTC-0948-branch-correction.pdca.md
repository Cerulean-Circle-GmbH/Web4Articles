# PDCA Entry: Branch Management Correction

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Correct branch management workflow - create dev/UTC-timestamp branch after first PDCA  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** Missing crucial step in startup procedure  
**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-branch-correction/pdca-branch-correction.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - User correctly identified missing step, correction implemented

**User Feedback:** "did you create a new branch dev/[utc timestamp] at the end and switched to it to continue your session?"

## Plan

1. **Update recovery documentation** - Add clear instructions about dev/UTC-timestamp branch creation
2. **Create timestamped branch** - Execute git checkout -b dev/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
3. **Push branch to origin** - Establish remote tracking
4. **Document the correction** - Create PDCA for this workflow improvement

## Do

### 1. Documentation Updates
Updated `/workspace/recovery/start-command.md`:
- Modified Branch Management Rules section to clarify workflow:
  - Start on save/start
  - Complete first PDCA on save/start
  - THEN create and switch to dev/UTC-timestamp branch
  - Continue all work on timestamped branch
- Updated Recovery Checklist step 10:
  - Changed from "Session End" to "Session Branch"
  - Added CRITICAL note: Do this RIGHT AFTER first PDCA commit

### 2. Branch Creation
- Created branch: `dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857`
- Command: `git checkout -b dev/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")`
- Successfully switched to new branch

### 3. Remote Push
- Pushed branch to origin with tracking
- Command: `git push -u origin dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857`
- GitHub suggested creating pull request (normal behavior)

### 4. PDCA Documentation
- Creating this PDCA on the new timestamped branch
- Following proper 6-section format

## Check

‚úÖ Recovery documentation updated with clear branch workflow  
‚úÖ Timestamped dev branch created: dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857  
‚úÖ Branch pushed to origin with tracking established  
‚úÖ Now working on correct branch for session continuation  
‚úÖ PDCA documentation created for this correction  

**Verification:**
```bash
$ git branch --show-current
dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857
```

## Act

### Next Steps:
1. Commit this PDCA and the documentation updates
2. Continue session work on dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857 branch
3. Remember this workflow for future sessions

### Improvements:
- Branch workflow now properly documented
- Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è emoji added for clarity
- Critical timing emphasized: create dev branch AFTER first PDCA, not at session end
- This ensures proper session isolation and tracking

### Learning:
The correct workflow is:
1. Start ‚Üí save/start branch
2. First PDCA ‚Üí commit on save/start (triggers auto-merge)
3. Create dev/UTC branch ‚Üí continue all work there
4. Session continues on timestamped branch
