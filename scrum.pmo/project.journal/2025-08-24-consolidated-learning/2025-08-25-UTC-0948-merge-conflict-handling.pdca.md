# PDCA Entry: Implement Merge Conflict Handling with PR Creation

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Update auto-merge script to handle conflicts by creating PRs and notifying QA  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** Auto-merge script fails silently on conflicts  
**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-merge-conflict-handling/pdca-merge-conflict-handling.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - User directive was clear: "on merge conflicts always notify QA and create a PR"

**User Feedback:** "on merge conflicts always notify QA and create a PR"

## Plan

1. **Add PR creation function** - Create function to handle conflict scenarios
2. **Update merge logic** - Detect conflicts and non-fast-forward pushes
3. **Add QA notifications** - Clear messages when conflicts occur
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't exit on errors, create PRs instead
5. **Test the implementation** - Verify PR creation works

## Do

### 1. Added PR Creation Function
Created `create_pr_on_conflict()` function that:
- Notifies QA with clear warning messages
- Attempts to create PR using GitHub CLI (gh)
- Falls back to manual instructions if CLI unavailable
- Includes detailed PR body with context

### 2. Updated Merge Logic
Modified `merge_to_release_dev()` to:
- Create temp branch from origin/release/dev (not current branch)
- Try merge and handle failures gracefully
- Detect both merge conflicts and push failures
- Create PRs for both scenarios

### 3. Key Changes:
- Changed `set -e` to `set +e` to handle errors gracefully
- Added proper error handling with if/else blocks
- Ensured cleanup happens even on failures
- Added clear QA notifications

### 4. PR Creation Details
When conflicts occur, the script will:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Merge conflict detected! Creating PR for QA review...
üìã QA NOTIFICATION: Merge conflict requires manual resolution
üîó Creating PR from [branch] to release/dev
```

## Check

‚úÖ PR creation function implemented  
‚úÖ Merge logic updated with proper error handling  
‚úÖ QA notifications added with clear messaging  
‚úÖ Script handles both merge conflicts and push failures  
‚úÖ Graceful error handling implemented  
‚è≥ Testing pending with next commit  

## Act

### Next Steps:
1. Commit this PDCA and observe the new behavior
2. Script should now successfully merge to release/dev
3. If future conflicts occur, PRs will be created automatically

### Improvements Made:
- No more silent failures
- Clear QA notifications on conflicts
- Automatic PR creation (with CLI) or manual instructions
- Proper cleanup of temporary branches

### Expected Behavior:
- Normal merges: Auto-merge to release/dev succeeds
- Conflicts: PR created, QA notified
- Non-fast-forward: PR created, QA notified
- All scenarios: Proper cleanup, clear messaging
