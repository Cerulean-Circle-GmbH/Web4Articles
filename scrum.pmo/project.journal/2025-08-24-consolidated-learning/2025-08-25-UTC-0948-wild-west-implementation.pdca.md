# PDCA Entry: Wild West Workflow Implementation - Force Push & Auto Cherry-Pick

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Implement wild west release/dev workflow with force push and auto cherry-pick  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** Need aggressive auto-merge and automatic file updates  
**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-wild-west-implementation/pdca-wild-west-implementation.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - Implementing user's specific choices (1a, 2c)

**User Feedback:** "1a\n2c alway pick all newest or newer files"

## Plan

1. **Decision 1a: Force Push** - Implement force push to release/dev
2. **Decision 2c: Auto Cherry-Pick** - Always pick all newest/newer files
3. **Update merge script** - Modify pdca-auto-merge.sh
4. **Add cherry-pick helper** - Create script for automatic file updates
5. **Test implementation** - Verify the workflow works

## Do

### 1. User Decisions Implemented
- **1a**: Force push all commits to release/dev (may overwrite)
- **2c**: Cherry-pick based on file patterns - specifically "always pick all newest or newer files"

### 2. Updated pdca-auto-merge.sh Strategy

The script will now:
```bash
# Force push approach for wild west branch
1. Fetch latest release/dev
2. Create temp branch from current work
3. Try normal merge first
4. If conflicts, force push with --force-with-lease
5. Always ensure commits reach release/dev
```

### 3. Cherry-Pick Helper Design

New script: `cherry-pick-newest.sh`
```bash
# After creating dev/UTC branch:
1. Compare files between current branch and release/dev
2. For each file in release/dev:
   - If newer than current branch version ‚Üí cherry-pick
   - If doesn't exist in current branch ‚Üí cherry-pick
3. Auto-commit all cherry-picked files
4. Report what was updated
```

### 4. Implementation Details

**Force Push Safety:**
- Use `--force-with-lease` instead of raw `--force`
- This prevents overwriting others' work unknowingly
- Still aggressive but slightly safer

**Auto Cherry-Pick Logic:**
- Compare file modification times
- Use `git log -1 --format=%ct -- <file>` for timestamps
- Cherry-pick entire files, not individual commits

## Check

‚úÖ User decisions clearly understood (1a, 2c)  
‚úÖ Force push strategy designed with safety considerations  
‚úÖ Auto cherry-pick for newest files planned  
‚úÖ Scripts to be implemented next  
‚è≥ Implementation pending  

**Key Understanding:** User wants aggressive sync - all commits to release/dev and automatic updates from release/dev

## Act

### Next Steps:
1. Implement the updated pdca-auto-merge.sh script
2. Create cherry-pick-newest.sh helper
3. Update start-command.md documentation
4. Test the workflow

### Expected Behavior:
- Every commit forcefully reaches release/dev
- On branch creation, all newer files auto-imported
- True "wild west" collection branch achieved
- Conflicts handled aggressively

### Risk Mitigation:
- Using --force-with-lease for safety
- Creating PRs as backup when needed
- Clear QA notifications on force actions
