# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Recovery Start - Background Agent Session Initialization**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-24-UTC-1248  
**🎯 Objective:** Execute recovery start procedure to establish PDCA workflow  
**👤 Role:** Background Agent → Recovery and Session Management  
**🚨 Issues:** User typed "start" requiring immediate recovery procedure execution  
**📎 Previous Commit:** N/A - New session start  
**🔗 Previous PDCA:** N/A - Initial session PDCA

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Recovery Objectives:**
1. Identify as Background Agent (not other roles)
2. Switch from cursor/* branch to save/start 
3. Create timestamped dev branch for session work
4. Install git automation hooks
5. Document process in PDCA format
6. Report with minimal chat and dual links

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Working on dev/2025-08-24-UTC-1248 branch
- Git hooks installed for auto-merge
- PDCA documentation created
- Minimal chat reporting established

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Branch Management**
```bash
# Started on cursor/start-background-process-1d44
git branch --show-current
# Output: cursor/start-background-process-1d44

# Switched to save/start as required
git checkout save/start
# Success: Switched to branch 'save/start'

# Created timestamped dev branch
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
# Success: Created and pushed dev/2025-08-24-UTC-1248
```

### **2. Git Automation Setup**
```bash
# Created post-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF

# Made hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### **3. PDCA Documentation**
- Verified PDCA guidelines exist: `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md`
- Read recovery procedure: `recovery/start-command.md`
- Created this PDCA following mandatory 6-section format
- Used dual link format for all references
