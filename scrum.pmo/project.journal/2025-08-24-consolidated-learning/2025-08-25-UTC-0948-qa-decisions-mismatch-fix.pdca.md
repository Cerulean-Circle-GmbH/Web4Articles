# PDCA Entry: Critical Fix - QA Decisions Must Match Between PDCA and Chat

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Objective:** Fix critical error where QA decisions in chat differ from PDCA  
**Role:** Background Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
**Issues:** QA decisions shown in chat completely different from PDCA content  
**Commits:** Pending

**Links:**

- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-qa-decisions-mismatch-fix/pdca-qa-decisions-mismatch-fix.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - This is a critical bug fix with clear user directive

**User Feedback:** "the qa questions in the pdca differ from the ones in the chat. the once in the chat are crazy. this should never happen."

## Plan

1. **Identify the problem** - QA decisions in chat don't match PDCA
2. **Update howto.PDCA.md** - Add critical warning about matching
3. **Document the fix** - Create PDCA for this correction
4. **Show correct behavior** - Display actual PDCA decisions in chat
5. **Prevent future errors** - Clear process documentation

## Do

### 1. Problem Identified
Previous chat showed:
- Decision 1: Cherry-Pick Strategy (a/b/c options)
- Decision 2: Branch Sync Approach (a/b/c options)

But the PDCA actually contained:
- Decision 1: Auto-Merge Strategy (a/b/c options)
- Decision 2: Cherry-Pick Strategy After Branch Creation (a/b/c options)

This is completely wrong and confusing!

### 2. Updated howto.PDCA.md
Added two critical sections:
- Step 5 in "After Creating PDCA": "Copy QA Decisions EXACTLY from PDCA to chat"
- New section "üö® CRITICAL: CHAT REPORTING ACCURACY" with clear examples

### 3. Key Changes Made
```markdown
## **üö® CRITICAL: CHAT REPORTING ACCURACY**

**NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS IN CHAT!**
- The QA Decisions shown in chat MUST be EXACTLY what's in the PDCA
- Copy-paste the exact decisions from the PDCA Summary section
- If PDCA says "All clear, no decisions to make" - say that in chat
- If PDCA has specific decisions - copy them VERBATIM to chat
- Creating different decisions in chat vs PDCA is a CRITICAL ERROR
```

## Check

‚úÖ Problem clearly identified - mismatch between PDCA and chat  
‚úÖ howto.PDCA.md updated with critical warnings  
‚úÖ Clear examples of wrong behavior documented  
‚úÖ User feedback addressed directly  
‚ö†Ô∏è This was a critical process failure  

**Verification:** The user correctly identified this as unacceptable behavior that "should never happen"

## Act

### Immediate Actions:
1. Always copy QA decisions EXACTLY from PDCA to chat
2. Never create new/different decisions in chat
3. If no decisions in PDCA, say "All clear, no decisions to make"

### Process Improvement:
- Updated howto.PDCA.md is now explicit about this requirement
- Added to validation checklist
- Clear examples of wrong behavior

### Correct Display for Previous PDCA:
From the wild west workflow PDCA, the CORRECT chat display should have been:

**Decision 1: Auto-Merge Strategy**
- a) Force push all commits to release/dev (may overwrite)
- b) Always merge with conflict resolution via PR
- c) Rebase and merge with automatic conflict handling

**Decision 2: Cherry-Pick Strategy After Branch Creation**
- a) Automatically cherry-pick all new files from release/dev
- b) Let agent choose what to cherry-pick interactively
- c) Cherry-pick based on file patterns or directories
