## **📋 Plan**

### **Objective**
Resolve merge conflicts by combining both versions intelligently

### **Resolution Strategy**
1. **index.md**: 
   - Keep the newer date (2025-08-19) from HEAD
   - Merge in any unique entries from the incoming version
   - Maintain GitHub links format from incoming version
   
2. **recovery.md**:
   - Keep all recovery entries from both versions
   - Maintain chronological order
   - Ensure no duplicate entries

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Conflict Analysis**
**index.md**:
- HEAD version: dated 2025-08-19, simple format
- Incoming version: dated 2025-08-15, has GitHub links
- Resolution: Use HEAD date, add GitHub links format

**recovery.md**:
- HEAD version: has entry for 2025-08-20T07:09:00Z
- Incoming version: missing this latest entry
- Resolution: Keep HEAD version with latest entry

### **Actions**
1. Resolving index.md by keeping HEAD version (it's more recent)
2. Resolving recovery.md by keeping HEAD version (it has our latest recovery)
3. Will stage resolved files
4. Complete the merge commit
