# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Branch Verification & 404 Issue - 2025-08-20**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-20-UTC-0723  
**🎯 Objective:** Verify branch status and resolve GitHub 404 errors  
**👤 Role:** ScrumMaster  
**🚨 Issues:** GitHub links returning 404 due to unpushed commits

## **✅ Summary**

**📊 Branch Status**
- [x] Confirmed on correct branch: test-merge/latest-48c865d
- [x] 540 commits ahead of origin (unpushed)
- [x] This explains 404 errors - files don't exist on GitHub yet
- [x] No accidental branch switch occurred

**🔗 Artifact Links**
- Local only (unpushed): scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-20-0709/pdca/2025-08-20-0723-branch-verification.md

---

## **📋 Plan**

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. Check current branch status
2. Verify remote configuration
3. Identify why links return 404
4. Document findings

### **Expected Behavior**
- Stay on test-merge/latest-48c865d
- Never push to release/dev
- GitHub links should work after push

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Investigation Steps**
```bash
# 1. Verified current branch
git branch --show-current
# Result: test-merge/latest-48c865d ✓

# 2. Checked remote branches
git branch -r | grep test-merge/latest-48c865d
# Result: origin/test-merge/latest-48c865d exists ✓

# 3. Checked git status
git status
# Result: 540 commits ahead of origin
```

### **Finding**
- We are on the correct branch
- No branch switch occurred
- The 404 errors are because we have 540 unpushed commits
- All PDCA files created today exist only locally

---

## **✓ Check**

### **Verification Results**
- ✅ Correct branch: test-merge/latest-48c865d
- ✅ No risk of pushing to release/dev
- ✅ Remote tracking properly configured
- ✅ 540 commits need to be pushed for GitHub links to work

### **Countermeasures Applied**
1. Verified branch integrity
2. Documented the unpushed state
3. Clarified that GitHub links will work after push
4. No actual countermeasures needed - system working as expected

---

## **📊 Act**

### **Recommendations**
1. **Push Decision**: User needs to decide when to push the 540 commits
2. **Link Strategy**: For now, provide local paths instead of GitHub links
3. **Branch Safety**: Continue monitoring branch switches
4. **Push Command**: When ready: `git push origin test-merge/latest-48c865d`

### **Lessons Learned**
- Always check push status when GitHub links fail
- 540 commits ahead indicates significant local work
- Branch protection working correctly - no accidental switches

### **Next Steps**
1. Continue work on test-merge/latest-48c865d
2. Wait for user decision on pushing
3. Update GitHub links after push
4. Monitor branch status regularly

---

**✅ Conclusion:** No branch switch occurred. We're safely on test-merge/latest-48c865d with 540 unpushed commits. GitHub 404 errors are expected until push.
