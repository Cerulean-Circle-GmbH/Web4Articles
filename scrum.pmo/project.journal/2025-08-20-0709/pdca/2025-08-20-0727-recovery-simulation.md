## **📋 Plan**

### **When User Says "Recover from README"**

```markdown
## CORRECT RESPONSE:

I'll help you recover from the README. Starting PDCA-compliant recovery process.

[1. Read README.md]
[2. Create session: 2025-08-20-HHMM]
[3. Create recovery PDCA]
[4. IMMEDIATELY: git add, commit, push]
[5. Verify GitHub link works]
[6. Continue recovery steps]
```

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Step-by-Step Correct Process**

```bash
# 1. Create session
SESSION=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/$SESSION/pdca

# 2. Create recovery PDCA
write recovery.pdca.md

# 3. CRITICAL - Add to git
git add .

# 4. CRITICAL - Commit
git commit -m "PDCA: Recovery session $SESSION started"

# 5. CRITICAL - Push
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)

# 6. Report with WORKING GitHub link
echo "✅ Recovery started: [GitHub](https://github.com/...)"
```

### **Each Subsequent PDCA**
```bash
# For EVERY new PDCA file:
write pdca/[timestamp]-[action].md
git add .
git commit -m "PDCA: [action] - [timestamp]"
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
# Verify link works!
```

---

## **✓ Check**

### **Correct Process Checklist**
- ✅ PDCA file created
- ✅ Git add executed
- ✅ Git commit with message
- ✅ Git push to origin
- ✅ GitHub link verified
- ✅ No accumulation of unpushed commits

### **What Success Looks Like**
- Each PDCA = 1 commit
- GitHub links always work
- No 404 errors
- Transparent progress tracking

## **📊 Act**

### **Recovery Process V5 Update**

Add to recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.v5.md:

```markdown
## MANDATORY: Commit/Push Per PDCA

CRITICAL: After creating ANY PDCA file:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "PDCA: [description]"
3. git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
4. Verify GitHub link in response

NEVER accumulate multiple PDCAs without pushing!
```

### **Template Response for "Recover from README"**

```markdown
I'll help you recover from the README. Starting PDCA-compliant recovery process.

*[Creates recovery PDCA]*
*[Commits and pushes immediately]*

✅ Recovery session started: [GitHub](working-link)

*[Continues with recovery steps, pushing after each PDCA]*
```

---

**✅ Conclusion:** Correct process documented. Will follow this template for all future recoveries.
