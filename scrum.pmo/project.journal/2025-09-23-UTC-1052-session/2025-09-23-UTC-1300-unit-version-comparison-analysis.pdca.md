# Results:
✅ 📊 Component Comparison Analysis successful
✅ 🔍 Analyzed 3 Unit component versions
✅ 📋 Generated comprehensive differences table
✅ 📊 Created detailed file comparison matrix
```

**2. Key Architectural Evolution Findings**
```yaml
Package Evolution:
  0.3.0.4_to_0.3.0.5: "Same package name @web4/unit"
  0.3.0.5_to_0.3.0.6: "Rebranded to @web4x/unit"

Dependency Strategy:
  0.3.0.4: "External @web4/defaultcli dependency"
  0.3.0.5: "Same external CLI dependency"
  0.3.0.6: "Self-contained, no external CLI dependency"

CLI Architecture:
  0.3.0.4: "Basic CLI with external dependency"
  0.3.0.5: "Enhanced CLI with comprehensive features"
  0.3.0.6: "Self-contained CLI with unit.sh script"

Version Maturity:
  0.3.0.4: "Foundation version with basic functionality"
