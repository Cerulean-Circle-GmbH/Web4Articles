Secondary Issues: 1. Auto-upgrade mechanism never triggers because file isn't loaded 2. Unit 0.3.0.6 upgrade logic incorrectly targets 0.3.0.6 but calls \`upgradeToVersion035()\` 3. CLI creates empty unit instead of loading specified unit file | Unit Auto-Migration Failure Analysis - CLI Parameter Parsing Issue |

Secondary Violations: 1. Added hardcoded switch cases when auto-discovery pattern exists 2. Failed to follow git push safety protocols 3. Modified CLI files when component method should have been sufficient | CMM1 Violation Analysis - Auto-Discovery vs Switch Cases |
