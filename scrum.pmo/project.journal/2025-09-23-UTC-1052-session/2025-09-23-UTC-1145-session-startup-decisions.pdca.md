### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - Investigation of modified core implementation files (DefaultWeb4TSComponent.ts, DefaultCLI.ts, TSCompletion.ts)
  - b) Architecture Focus - Analysis of new dist/ and node_modules/ directories impact on build process
  - c) Quality/Testing Focus - Deep investigation of 48.6% test failure rate and new file-protection test correlation
  - d) Documentation Focus - Comprehensive regression analysis documentation and version comparison refinement

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Current Unknown Agent for coordination and multi-perspective analysis
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation examination and code analysis
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design impact assessment and build process evaluation  
  - d) Switch to Tester for regression test analysis and failure investigation
  - e) Switch to Process Coordinator for comprehensive PDCA documentation and workflow optimization

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles covering all analysis aspects
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific regression issue investigation
  - c) Quick analysis session for immediate component status review and next steps
  - d) Extended multi-day session for complete version comparison and regression resolution
