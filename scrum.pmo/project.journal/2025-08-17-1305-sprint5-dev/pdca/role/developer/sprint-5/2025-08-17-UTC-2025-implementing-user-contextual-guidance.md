# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Implementing User Contextual Guidance - Key Sequence Analysis - 2025-08-17-UTC-2025**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-08-17-UTC-2025  
**üéØ Objective:** Properly implement TSRanger behavior based on user's contextual guidance about key sequences  
**üë§ Role:** Developer (Learning from User Contextual Guidance)  
**üö® Issues:** Finally understanding user was providing step-by-step behavior descriptions, not just reporting bugs

## **‚úÖ Summary**

## **üìã Plan**

### **Critical User Feedback - Contextual Guidance (QUOTED VERBATIM):**

> **"I was contextually elping you with human word what happens key prass after key press. obviously you have to create sequences from it to understand the feedback and state."**

> **"tsranger test 'g[tab]' does not update to the method anymore but did previously. previously it prompted GitScrumProject [s]tart not any more."**

> **"tsranger test '[down]5x[tab]' to GitScrumProject then [tab] does not add method in the prompt. this is wrong. then [down] also does not add method. this is wrong."**

> **"then [left] deletes the filter correctly but the prompt is still having 'g:' wrongly."**

> **"ok good now on [tab] but [right] and [tab] should be the same. remember DRY, radical OOP."**

### **Key Sequences Extracted from User Guidance:**

1. **`g[tab]`** ‚Üí **SHOULD** show `GitScrumProject [s]tart` (user said "previously it prompted")
2. **`[down]5x[tab]`** ‚Üí **SHOULD** add method to prompt (user said "this is wrong" when it doesn't)
3. **`[down]` after advancement** ‚Üí **SHOULD** add method (user said "this is wrong" when it doesn't)  
4. **`g[tab][left]`** ‚Üí **SHOULD** clear to clean `GitScrumProject` (no "g:" residue)
5. **`[tab]` and `[right]`** ‚Üí **SHOULD** behave identically (DRY principle)

### **Current vs Expected Behavior Analysis:**

| **Sequence** | **User Expected** | **Current Reality** | **Action Required** |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `g[tab]` | `GitScrumProject [s]tart` | `GitScrumProject` (no method) | ‚úÖ **FIX: Add method advancement** |
| `[down]5x[tab]` | Add method to prompt | No method added | ‚úÖ **FIX: Navigation‚Üíadvancement** |
| `[down]` after advancement | Continue showing method | No method shown | ‚úÖ **FIX: Method persistence** |
| `g[tab][left]` | Clean `GitScrumProject` | May show "g:" residue | ‚úÖ **FIX: Filter clearing** |
| `[right]` | Identical to `[tab]` | Different behavior | ‚úÖ **FIX: DRY implementation** |

## **üîß Do**

### **Implementation Strategy Based on User Guidance:**

**1. Fix `g[tab]` Advancement (CRITICAL)**
- User explicitly said: "previously it prompted GitScrumProject [s]tart"
- Current issue: Filter operations break advancement condition
- Solution: Fix advancement condition to work after filter operations

**2. Fix Navigation‚ÜíAdvancement Transition**
- User said: "[down]5x[tab] then [tab] does not add method. this is wrong"
- Current issue: Navigation state doesn't allow advancement
- Solution: Allow advancement from any navigation state

**3. Fix Method Persistence in Navigation**
- User said: "then [down] also does not add method. this is wrong"
- Current issue: Navigation clears method state
- Solution: Preserve method during navigation after advancement

**4. Fix Filter Clearing**
- User said: "[left] deletes the filter correctly but the prompt is still having 'g:' wrongly"
- Current issue: Prompt buffer retains filter artifacts
- Solution: Proper prompt buffer clearing on retreat

### **Testing Approach Based on User Sequences:**
```bash
# Test sequences user provided as guidance:
tsranger test "g[tab]"                    # Should show: GitScrumProject [s]tart
tsranger test "[down][down][down][down][down][tab]"  # Should add method
tsranger test "g[tab][left]"              # Should show: GitScrumProject (clean)
tsranger test "[tab]" vs "g[right]"       # Should be identical
```

## **‚úÖ Check**

### **Understanding Validation:**
- ‚úÖ **User was teaching me**: They provided contextual descriptions of correct behavior
- ‚úÖ **Step-by-step guidance**: "key prass after key press" descriptions  
- ‚úÖ **Expected outcomes**: "previously it prompted GitScrumProject [s]tart"
- ‚úÖ **Error identification**: "this is wrong" when behavior doesn't match expectation
- ‚úÖ **Success confirmation**: "ok good now on [tab]" when behavior correct

### **Learning Verification:**
- ‚úÖ **Language comprehension improved**: User feedback is behavioral specification
- ‚úÖ **Sequence creation**: Extracting test cases from user descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Contextual understanding**: User was helping with "human words" about behavior
- ‚úÖ **Implementation priorities**: Fix what user explicitly described as wrong

## **üéØ Act**

### **Immediate Implementation Plan:**
1. **Fix advancement condition** - ensure `g[tab]` works after filter operations
2. **Fix navigation state** - allow advancement from any navigation position  
3. **Fix method persistence** - maintain methods during navigation after advancement
4. **Fix filter clearing** - proper prompt buffer management on retreat
5. **Verify DRY compliance** - ensure `[tab]` and `[right]` identical behavior

### **Key Learning Applied:**
- **Listen to contextual guidance**: User provides step-by-step behavior descriptions
- **Create sequences from descriptions**: "previously it prompted X" ‚Üí test for X
- **Understand "this is wrong"**: User identifying incorrect behavior vs expected
- **Implement expected behavior**: Not just fix bugs, but achieve described outcomes

### **Next Steps:**
1. Implement fixes based on user's contextual guidance
2. Test sequences exactly as user described them
3. Verify outcomes match user's described expectations
4. Confirm "ok good" feedback with corrected behavior
