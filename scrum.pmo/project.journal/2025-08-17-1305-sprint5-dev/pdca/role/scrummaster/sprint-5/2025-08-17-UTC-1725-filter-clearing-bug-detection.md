# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Filter Clearing Bug Detection and Test Implementation - 2025-08-17-UTC-1725**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-17-UTC-1725  
**🎯 Objective:** Document and create test case for filter clearing bug in g[right][down][left] sequence  
**👤 Role:** Developer (Bug Detection & Test Infrastructure)  
**🚨 Issues:** User observation: "in case tsranger test "g[right][down][left]" no filter should be set on class"

## **✅ Summary**

**📊 QA Decisions**
- [x] Bug confirmed and reproduced
- [x] Test case successfully detects the issue (fails as expected)
- [x] Root cause identified: filter not being cleared during navigation
- [x] Regression prevention test implemented
- [x] Issue documented for future fix

## **📝 Plan**

**User Issue Analysis:**
- Sequence: `g[right][down][left]`
- Expected: `[Classes]` (no filter)
- Actual: `[Classes] (GitScrumProject)` (filter still active)

**Investigation Strategy:**
1. Reproduce the issue manually
2. Create test case to detect the bug
3. Verify test correctly fails
4. Document for future fix

**Test Implementation Approach:**
- Add test case to existing regression test suite
- Capture final state (not intermediate states)
- Validate filter absence using regex pattern matching
- Ensure test fails correctly to detect bug

---

## **🔧 Do**

**Bug Reproduction:**
```bash
components/TSRanger/v2.0/sh/tsranger test "g[right][down][left]"
```

**Sequence Analysis:**
1. `g` → `[Classes] (g)` (filter applied) ✅
2. `[right]` → `[Classes] (g)` (still filtered) ✅
3. `[down]` → `[Classes] (g)` (still filtered) ✅  
4. `[left]` → `[Classes] (GitScrumProject)` (filter changed but not cleared) ❌

**Test Implementation:**
```typescript
it('Filter clearing sequence: g[right][down][left] - should clear class filter', () => {
  const out = runScripted('g[right][down][left]');
  const lines = stripAnsi(out).split(/\r?\n/);
  
  // Get final state (last occurrence of Classes header)
  const classesLines = lines.filter(l => l.includes('[Classes]'));
  const classesHeader = classesLines[classesLines.length - 1] || '';
  
  // Should NOT have filter parentheses like (GitScrumProject)
  expect(classesHeader).not.toMatch(/\[Classes\]\s+\([^)]+\)/);
});
```

## **✅ Check**

**QA Feedback:** *User observation: "in case tsranger test "g[right][down][left]" no filter should be set on class" - 2025-08-17-UTC-1725*

**Bug Confirmation:**
✅ **Issue Reproduced:**
- Final state shows `[Classes] (GitScrumProject)` instead of `[Classes]`
- Filter is retained instead of being cleared
- Navigation sequence affects filter state incorrectly

✅ **Test Implementation Validation:**
- Test correctly fails with expected error message
- Pattern matching accurately detects filter presence
- Final state capture working (last occurrence vs first occurrence)
- Debug output confirmed exact issue: `"[Classes] (GitScrumProject)"`

✅ **Root Cause Analysis:**
- `[left]` key in navigation context not clearing class filter
- Filter state persistence through navigation actions
- Sequence changes filter value but doesn't remove it entirely

---

## **🎯 Act**

**Immediate Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Bug reproduced and confirmed
2. ✅ Test case implemented and validates correctly
3. ✅ Failing test committed as regression detection
4. ✅ Issue documented for future fix

**Test Infrastructure Value:**
- **Regression Detection:** Test will catch filter clearing issues
- **Fix Validation:** Test will pass once bug is resolved
- **Behavior Documentation:** Clear expected vs actual behavior
- **Quality Assurance:** Prevents future filter state bugs

**Technical Learning:**
- Navigation state affects filter persistence
- Test pattern matching requires careful final state capture
- Complex sequences can have subtle state management issues
- Importance of testing final outcomes vs intermediate states

**Next Steps for Resolution:**
- Investigate filter clearing logic in navigation handlers
- Identify where `[left]` should clear class filters
- Implement proper filter state management
- Verify test passes after fix implementation
