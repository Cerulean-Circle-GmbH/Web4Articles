**🗓️ Date:** 2025-09-26-UTC-0909  
**🎯 Objective:** Rename current session branch to indicate broken state and reset save/start to previous stable commit  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1  

**👤 Agent Name:** Background Agent → Git Recovery Specialist  
**👤 Agent Role:** Background Agent → Branch management and repository recovery operations  
**👤 Branch:** dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0900 → To be renamed to broken branch

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **GitHub PDCA:** [branch-recovery.md](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0900/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session/2025-09-26-UTC-0909-branch-recovery.md)
- **Local PDCA:** [branch-recovery.md](./2025-09-26-UTC-0909-branch-recovery.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Branch Rename Strategy**
  - a) Rename to "broken/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session" to preserve timestamp and indicate state
  - b) Rename to "broken/startup-issues" for generic broken branch naming
  - c) Rename to "archive/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-broken" to indicate archived broken state

- [ ] **Decision 2: Save/Start Reset Method**
  - a) Hard reset save/start to cfd28eeb (⚠️ WARNING: Will delete commits c7330a60 and 36b5c422 from save/start)
  - b) Create backup branch before reset, then hard reset save/start
  - c) Soft reset to preserve working directory changes

### **User Feedback**
User requested: "rename this branch, commit c7330a60, to broken branch and reset the save/start back to commit cfd28eeb"

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
Execute safe branch recovery operation:
1. Rename current dev branch to indicate broken state
2. Switch to save/start branch 
3. Reset save/start to specified commit (cfd28eeb)
4. Preserve current work in renamed broken branch
5. Ensure no data loss through proper branch management

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ✅ Current branch renamed to broken/* for preservation
- ✅ save/start branch reset to commit cfd28eeb stable state
- ✅ All work preserved in renamed branch
- ✅ Clean repository state for fresh start
- ✅ Proper documentation of recovery operation

## **⚙️ DO**

### **Pre-Operation State Documentation**
- **Current Branch:** dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0900
- **Current HEAD:** 36b5c422 (Commit history analysis PDCA)
- **Target Reset Commit:** cfd28eeb (PDCA: Session completion summary)
- **Commits to be removed from save/start:** c7330a60, 36b5c422

### **Recovery Operation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Branch Rename** 
```bash
# Rename current branch to preserve work
git branch -m dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0900 broken/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session
git push origin broken/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session
git push origin --delete dev/2025-09-26-UTC-0900
```

#### **Step 2: Switch to save/start**
```bash
# Switch to save/start for reset operation
git checkout save/start
```

#### **Step 3: Reset save/start to stable commit**
```bash
# ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE: Reset save/start to cfd28eeb
git reset --hard cfd28eeb
git push --force origin save/start
```

### **Safety Considerations**
- Current work preserved in broken/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session
- Force push required for save/start reset
- Commits c7330a60 and 36b5c422 will be removed from save/start
- All session PDCAs preserved in renamed branch

---

## **🔍 CHECK**

### **Validation Steps**
1. **Branch Preservation:** Verify broken branch contains all session work
2. **Reset Verification:** Confirm save/start HEAD is at cfd28eeb
3. **Data Integrity:** Ensure no work is lost in operation
4. **Remote Sync:** Verify all changes pushed to remote repository

### **Expected Final State**
- **save/start HEAD:** cfd28eeb (Session completion summary)
- **Broken Branch:** broken/2025-09-26-UTC-0900-session with full session history
- **Working Directory:** Clean state on save/start
- **Remote State:** Synchronized with local changes

---

## **🚀 ACT**

### **Implementation Required**
User decision needed on:
1. **Branch naming convention** for broken branch
2. **Reset method** for save/start (with or without backup)

### **Post-Recovery Actions**
- Verify repository state integrity
- Confirm all session work preserved
- Document lessons learned from recovery operation
- Prepare for fresh session restart if needed

### **Risk Mitigation**
- All work preserved in renamed branch
- Force push clearly documented and intentional
- Operation can be reversed if needed
- Clean separation between broken and stable states
