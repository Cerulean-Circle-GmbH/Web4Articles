# PDCA - Role Continuation: OntologyAgent

**Date**: 2025-08-16 UTC 20:54  
**Type**: Role Transition (Continuation)  
**Session**: 2025-08-16-2052-recovery  
**From Role**: OntologyAgent (previous session)  
**To Role**: OntologyAgent (continuing)  

## Plan

### **Objective**
Continue as OntologyAgent after pulling release/dev updates, maintaining context from previous session while adapting to new process requirements.

### **Scope**
- **In Scope**: 
  - Preserve OntologyAgent context from 2025-08-14-1040 session
  - Review new terminology from release/dev updates
  - Adapt to new project journal structure
  - Maintain ontology monitoring readiness
- **Out of Scope**: 
  - Major ontology updates without specific tasks
  - Role switching to other agents

### **Targets (metrics)**
- **Context Preservation**: 100% previous work maintained
- **New Terms**: Identify any from release/dev updates
- **Process Compliance**: Follow new PDCA structure

### **Inputs**
- Previous OntologyAgent PDCA (2025-08-14-UTC-1032)
- Current ontology status (180+ terms)
- New components and scripts from release/dev

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] OntologyAgent context preserved
- [ ] New terminology identified if present
- [ ] Ready for background monitoring
- [ ] Compliant with new process

## Do

1. Reviewed previous OntologyAgent status ✓
   - 180+ indexed terms across all categories
   - CMM Level 4 compliance confirmed
   - Recent EAMD.ucp merge completed

2. Identified potential new terminology from updates ✓
   - TreeIndexGenerator (new component)
   - RecoveryDefinitionAgent (new role)
   - CICDAgent (new role)
   - Session-based PDCA organization
   - Role transitions, tasks categories

3. Adapted to new process structure ✓
   - Using new PDCA categories appropriately
   - Following session-based organization
   - Maintaining enhanced traceability

## Check

### Evidence
- OntologyAgent was last active role in previous session
- No pending ontology tasks found in updated sprints
- New components and roles introduce terminology not yet indexed
- Process updates require ontology alignment

### Verification
```bash
# Check ontology status
ls -la /workspace/Documentation/Ontology.md/
# Result: All indexes present from previous work

# Check for new roles
ls -la /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/
# Result: New roles added (RecoveryDefinitionAgent, CICDAgent)
```

## Act

### Actions Taken
1. Preserved OntologyAgent context successfully
2. Identified new terminology requiring future indexing
3. Adapted to new project journal structure
4. Documented role continuation

### Next Steps
1. Monitor for explicit ontology update tasks
2. Background tracking of new terminology:
   - TreeIndexGenerator component
   - RecoveryDefinitionAgent role
   - CICDAgent role  
   - Session-based PDCA concepts
3. Maintain semantic consistency
4. Support other agents as needed

### Role Status
- **OntologyAgent**: Operational and monitoring
- **Ontology Health**: Excellent (180+ terms)
- **New Terms Identified**: 5+ pending background integration
- **Process Compliance**: Following new structure
