- Previous session work (PO and OntologyAgent)
- Current branch state

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] New session directory created with proper structure
- [ ] Session start PDCA documented
- [ ] Previous work context preserved
- [ ] Ready for continued operations

## Do

1. Pulled latest changes from release/dev ✓
   - Received extensive updates including new recovery process
   - New templates and project journal structure
   - Tree index generator component
   - Multiple new scripts and documentation

2. Created new session directory structure ✓
   - `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-2052-recovery/`
   - `pdca/role-transitions/`
   - `pdca/tasks/`
   - `pdca/session/`

3. Creating session documentation ⏳
   - This session start PDCA
   - Project state to follow
   - Tree index generation

## Check

### QA Prompt
```
ok pull form release/dev and create a new project journal session as described in the recovery process updates
```

### Evidence
- Successfully pulled 224 files changed from release/dev
- New recovery process includes enhanced project journal structure
- Template specifies three PDCA categories: role-transitions, tasks, session
- Session type "recovery" appropriate for this context

### Verification
```bash
# Verify pull success
git log -1 --oneline
# Result: Latest commit from release/dev

# Check new session structure
ls -la /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-2052-recovery/
# Result: Directory created with PDCA subdirectories
```
