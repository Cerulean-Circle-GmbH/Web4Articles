### **My Answer**
Background Agent initialized according to Web4Articles startup protocol. Created session directory, established dev branch, and presenting standard startup decisions for work direction alignment.

**Learning Applied:** Following structured startup decision framework ensures clear session objectives and user alignment

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish clear work direction for Web4Articles DAPP development session

**Requirements Traceability:** Background Agent startup protocol from README.md

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Session Infrastructure:** Create timestamped session directory and dev branch for proper version control
- **Decision Framework:** Present 3 standard startup decisions covering focus area, role selection, and session duration
- **PDCA Compliance:** Follow template v3.0 with all 6 mandatory sections and proper dual links

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Infrastructure Setup**

**1. Session Directory Created**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-31-UTC-1339-session
```

**2. Project Status File Created**
```bash
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-31-UTC-1339-session/project.status.md
```

**3. Dev Branch Established**
```bash
git checkout -b dev/2025-08-31-UTC-1339
git push -u origin dev/2025-08-31-UTC-1339
```

**4. Session Start PDCA Created**
- Following template v3.0 format
- Implementing startup decision framework
- Presenting 3 standard decision categories
