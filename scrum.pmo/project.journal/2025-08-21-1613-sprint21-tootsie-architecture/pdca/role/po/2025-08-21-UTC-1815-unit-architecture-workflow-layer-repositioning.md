# 🏗️ UNIT ARCHITECTURE WORKFLOW LAYER REPOSITIONING
**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 18:15 UTC  
**Objective:** Create Web4Requirement scenario for architectural change repositioning Unit Workflow Engine from Layer 4 to Layer 5  
**Role:** Product Owner  
**Issue:** Incorrect architectural layer assignment - workflows are user role specific screen/view transitions, not business processes

### ✅ QA Decisions  
- [x] **Architecture Correction:** Unit Workflow Engine repositioned from Layer 4 to Layer 5
- [x] **Layer Responsibility Clarification:** Workflows = user role screen/view transitions (Layer 5), Business Processes = corporate processes (Layer 4)
- [x] **Web4Requirement Usage:** Prose requirement converted to structured scenario using established framework
- [x] **UUID Generation:** Proper scenario file naming with generated UUID
- [x] **Change Classification:** Architectural documentation change with full backward compatibility
- [x] **Version Impact:** Minor version increment (0.1.0.0 → 0.1.1.0) for architectural clarification

## Plan

**OBJECTIVE:** Create comprehensive Web4Requirement scenario for Unit architecture layer reorganization

**SCOPE:** 
- Convert prose requirement into structured Web4 scenario format
- Define architectural change from current to corrected layer organization
- Establish acceptance criteria for proper workflow vs business process separation
- Document traceability to affected components and validation requirements
- Store scenario in established requirements folder with UUID naming

**APPROACH:**
1. **UUID Generation:** Create unique identifier for requirement scenario
2. **Prose Analysis:** Convert user requirement into structured behavioral specification
3. **Architectural Mapping:** Define current vs target layer organization
4. **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable criteria for architecture correction
5. **Scenario Storage:** Save as JSON in spec/requirements/ following Web4 patterns

## Do

### 🎯 Requirement Scenario Creation

**Scenario Generated:**
- **UUID**: `7e4d5c6b-8a9f-4e2d-b3c1-5f8e9d7a6b4c`
- **Filename**: `7e4d5c6b-8a9f-4e2d-b3c1-5f8e9d7a6b4c.scenario.json`
- **Location**: `components/Unit/latest/spec/requirements/`

**Prose Requirement Captured:**
> "workflows are user role specific screen or view transitions between actions. therefore 'Unit Workflow Engine' would be in layer 5. business processes are corporate processes connecting role specific workflows."

### 🏗️ Architectural Change Definition

**Current Architecture (Incorrect):**
- **Layer 4**: Unit Workflow Engine, Unit Process Coordinator, Unit Transaction Manager
- **Layer 5**: Unit Inspector, Unit Coordinator, Unit Developer Tools

**Target Architecture (Corrected):**
- **Layer 4**: Unit Process Coordinator (Business Processes), Unit Transaction Manager  
- **Layer 5**: Unit Workflow Engine (User Role Workflows), Unit Inspector, Unit Coordinator, Unit Developer Tools

**Key Distinction Established:**
- **User Workflows (Layer 5)**: Role-specific screen/view transitions between actions
- **Business Processes (Layer 4)**: Corporate processes connecting role-specific workflows

### 📋 Acceptance Criteria Definition

**Critical Validation Points:**
1. Unit Workflow Engine moved from Layer 4 to Layer 5
2. Layer 4 focuses on business process coordination (corporate level)
3. Layer 5 handles user experience including role-specific workflows
4. PlantUML architecture diagram reflects corrected organization
5. Component interfaces remain unchanged (backward compatible)
6. Documentation explains workflow vs business process distinction

### 🔗 Traceability Network Established

**Implementation Units:**
- UnitArchitecture.puml - Layer diagram update
- Layer 4 components - Business process focus
- Layer 5 components - User workflow integration

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Updated PlantUML diagram showing corrected layer organization
- Layer component organization matches architectural principles
- Clear documentation of workflows vs business processes distinction

### 🎛️ Change Impact Assessment

**Classification**: Architectural documentation change
**Risk Level**: Low - primarily visualization and documentation
**Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible
**Effort Estimate**: 2-4 hours for diagram and documentation updates
