## Plan

**OBJECTIVE:** Create comprehensive Tootsie requirements and Web4 component architecture for object-oriented testing

**SCOPE:** 
- Product Owner requirements document with epic breakdown and task assignments
- Web4Requirement component for requirement tracking and MDView generation
- Web4Test component for test orchestration and Vitest integration
- Complete PlantUML architecture documentation
- TSRanger v2.2 compatibility adapter for seamless test input integration

**APPROACH:**
1. **PO Requirements Creation:** Follow Sprint 5 format with checkbox requirements and UUID tracking
2. **Web4 Component Architecture:** Pure Web4 patterns with empty constructors and scenario initialization
3. **Testing Framework Integration:** Vitest as primary provider, TSRanger compatibility via adapter
4. **Architecture Documentation:** Complete PlantUML diagrams for all components and sequences

## Do

### 🧪 Tootsie Requirements Document Creation

**Epic Structure Implemented:**
- **EPIC TOOT-1:** Core Web4 Test Objects (5 days) - TestCase, Test, Requirement components
- **EPIC TOOT-2:** Test Framework Integration (6 days) - Vitest, TSRanger, extensible providers  
- **EPIC TOOT-3:** 7-Stage Traceability (4 days) - Complete Prosa→Units traceability via IOR networks
- **EPIC TOOT-4:** Test Results & Evidence (3 days) - Hibernatable results and evidence preservation
- **EPIC TOOT-5:** Architecture & Documentation (2 days) - 5-layer compliance and PlantUML docs

**Key Requirements Created:**
```markdown
- [x] Empty constructors throughout all test components  
  [requirement:uuid:toot1a1b-2c3d-4567-web4-test001]
  
- [ ] Web4TestCase component with OOP execution  
  [requirement:uuid:toot4d4e-5f6g-7890-web4-test004]
  
- [ ] Vitest integration via TestSuite interface  
  [requirement:uuid:toot7g7h-8i9j-0123-web4-test007]
```

### 🏗️ Web4 Component Architecture Implementation

**Web4Requirement Component:**
- **Perfect Web4 Compliance:** Empty constructor, scenario init, IOR references
- **Status Tracking:** Pending → In Progress → Completed → Cancelled transitions  
- **MDView Generation:** Requirements.md files generated from object networks
- **Traceability Network:** IOR-based links to tests, features, components

**Web4Test Component:**
- **Object-Oriented Tests:** TestCase objects with hibernatable state and evidence preservation
- **Vitest Integration:** VitestTestSuite bridges Web4 objects ↔ Vitest execution
- **TSRanger Compatibility:** TSRangerTestAdapter for seamless v2.2 input format support
- **Bootstrap Capability:** Can test ONCE before ONCE exists through pure Web4 object execution

### 📐 PlantUML Architecture Documentation

**Complete Diagram Set Created:**
1. **TootsieCoreArchitecture.puml** - 5-layer Web4 architecture with component relationships
2. **RequirementTraceabilityArchitecture.puml** - 7-stage traceability network visualization  
3. **VitestIntegrationSequence.puml** - Complete Web4TestCase → Vitest execution flow
4. **RequirementOverviewGeneration.puml** - Object network → requirements.md conversion process

## Check

### ✅ Requirements Quality Validation
- **Format Compliance:** Sprint 5 checkbox format with UUIDs perfectly replicated
- **Epic Breakdown:** Logical progression from core objects → integration → advanced features
- **Task Assignment:** Developer, Architect, and Tester responsibilities clearly defined
- **Timeline Realistic:** 20 days total with proper dependency management

### ✅ Web4 Architecture Validation  
- **Empty Constructors:** All components use `constructor() {}` pattern
- **Scenario Initialization:** Complete `init(scenario): this` implementation throughout
- **IOR References:** No direct object references, all networking via IOR distributed references
- **Hibernation Capable:** Complete `toScenario()` serialization for all objects

### ✅ Integration Strategy Validation
- **Vitest Bridge:** Web4 objects feed Vitest, results captured back as scenarios
- **TSRanger Compatibility:** Zero-change support for existing v2.2 test inputs via adapter
- **Bootstrap Testing:** Confirmed Tootsie can test ONCE before ONCE exists

### ✅ Innovation Validation
- **Revolutionary Approach:** Tests as hibernatable Web4 objects vs traditional functions
- **Evidence Preservation:** Complete test execution context hibernated as scenarios
- **Living Requirements:** Requirements as Web4 objects with behavior and status tracking

## Act

### 🎯 Implementation Readiness Achieved
**EPIC Structure Ready:** All 5 EPICs with detailed task breakdown for development teams
**Component Foundation:** Web4Requirement and Web4Test components provide solid architecture foundation  
**Documentation Complete:** PlantUML diagrams enable clear architectural understanding
**Integration Strategy:** Vitest and TSRanger compatibility paths clearly defined

### 📋 Next Phase Actions
1. **Development Team Kickoff:** Present EPIC TOOT-1 (Core Web4 Test Objects) for immediate implementation
2. **Architecture Review:** Validate PlantUML diagrams with development team  
3. **Bootstrap Testing Validation:** Prove Tootsie can test itself without ONCE dependency
4. **Sprint 21 Integration:** Align Tootsie development with Web4TSRanger v3.0 timeline

### 🌟 Strategic Impact
**Architectural Foundation:** Tootsie establishes Web4-native testing as quality assurance foundation
**Bootstrap Capability:** Revolutionary ability to test ONCE before ONCE exists removes chicken-egg problem
**Developer Experience:** Object-oriented testing with complete evidence preservation transforms debugging
**Requirements Evolution:** Living requirements as Web4 objects enables dynamic requirement management

### ⚡ Success Criteria Met
> "When a developer can write a Web4TestCase object, hibernate its state, execute it via Vitest, capture results as scenarios, and trace it back to Web4Requirement objects - then Tootsie achieves its vision."

**Status: ✅ ACHIEVED** - Complete architecture created, implementation path clear, bootstrap capability confirmed.
