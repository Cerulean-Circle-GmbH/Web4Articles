# 📋 REQUIREMENT SCENARIOS GENERATION
**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 18:35 UTC  
**Objective:** Generate proper Web4Requirement scenario files for all user prompts quoted in previous PDCAs using CLI  
**Role:** Product Owner  
**Issue:** Need to create proper requirement scenarios using Web4Requirement CLI for all user requirements previously documented  

---

## Summary

### 🔗 Artifact Links
- **Generated Scenarios:** [components/Unit/latest/spec/requirements/](../../../../../components/Unit/latest/spec/requirements/)
- **Web4Requirement CLI:** [components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/requirement.sh](../../../../../components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/requirement.sh)
- **Temporary Fix:** PROJECT_ROOT environment variable for path resolution

### ✅ QA Decisions  
- [x] **Temporary Fix Applied:** Added PROJECT_ROOT environment variable support to requirement.sh
- [x] **TODO CRITICAL Comments:** Added proper temporary fix documentation with migration notes
- [x] **Scenario Generation:** Created proper Web4Requirement scenarios for all user prompts
- [x] **CLI Functionality:** Successfully used Web4Requirement CLI to generate scenarios
- [x] **Proper JSON Structure:** All scenarios follow IOR/owner/model structure
- [x] **User Requirements Captured:** All previous PDCA-quoted user prompts converted to scenarios

## Plan

**OBJECTIVE:** Generate proper Web4Requirement scenarios for all user prompts using enhanced CLI

**SCOPE:** 
- Apply temporary PROJECT_ROOT environment variable fix to requirement.sh
- Generate requirement scenarios for all user prompts quoted in previous PDCAs
- Verify proper JSON structure with IOR/owner/model format
- Document temporary fix and need for Web4 IOR-based component discovery
- Validate scenario generation functionality

**APPROACH:**
1. **Temporary Fix**: Add PROJECT_ROOT support to requirement.sh with TODO CRITICAL comments
2. **Scenario Generation**: Create scenarios for each user prompt using CLI
3. **Structure Validation**: Verify proper IOR/owner/model JSON structure
4. **Documentation**: Document generated scenarios and temporary fix approach

---

## Do

### 🔧 Temporary Fix Implementation

**Shell Script Enhancement:**
```bash
# @TODO @CRITICAL: Temporary fix using PROJECT_ROOT environment variable
# This is a temporary solution and needs to be migrated to proper Web4 component discovery

# @TODO @CRITICAL: PROJECT_ROOT should be replaced with proper Web4 IOR-based component resolution
if [ -n "$PROJECT_ROOT" ]; then
    CLI_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/dist/layer5/RequirementCLI.js"
else
    CLI_PATH="$SCRIPT_DIR/dist/layer5/RequirementCLI.js"
fi
```

**Migration Notes Added:**
- Temporary solution requires PROJECT_ROOT environment variable
- Should be migrated to Web4 IOR-based component discovery
- Critical priority for proper Web4 architecture compliance

### 📋 Requirement Scenarios Generated

**Scenario 1: Unit Architecture Layer Workflow Engine Repositioning**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Architecture Layer Workflow Engine Repositioning" "workflows are user role specific screen or view transitions between actions. therefore Unit Workflow Engine would be in layer 5. business processes are corporate processes connecting role specific workflows."
```

**Scenario 2: Unit Radical Semantic Versioning Implementation**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Radical Semantic Versioning Implementation" "from now on use in the unit radical semantic versioning. as this is not yet fully specified only mention in the pdca metadate next to the prvious commit sha the tag you would use for the unit component version. we start with 0.1.0.0-initial"
```

**Scenario 3: Unit Specification Requirements Scenario Structure**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Specification Requirements Scenario Structure" "lets create a spec folder next to src. in it a folder storing the requirements as scenarios. i write prosa requirements and you convert them itno scenarios and store thes in a requirment folder in the spec folder. so use the Web4Requirement for this."
```

**Scenario 4: Web4Requirement CLI Enhancement**
```bash
requirement create "Web4Requirement CLI Enhancement" "i doubt that you created it by using the Web4Requirement. make improve the Web4Requirement component in a way that you can create a Web4Requirement from calling the sh file requirement.sh that starts Web4Requirement component and takes the prosaRequirement-value as CLI input."
```

### 🎯 CLI Execution Results

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT="/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles"
```

**Scenario Generation:**
- All scenarios successfully generated using Web4Requirement CLI
- Proper IOR/owner/model JSON structure maintained
- UUID-based filenames created automatically
- Console feedback provided for each scenario creation

### 📊 Generated Files Validation

**JSON Structure Verification:**
```json
{
  "IOR": {
    "uuid": "generated-uuid",
    "component": "Web4Requirement",
    "version": "v1.0"
  },
  "owner": "base64-encoded-owner-data",
  "model": {
    "uuid": "same-uuid-as-ior",
    "description": "original-prose-requirement"
  }
}
```

**Owner Data Structure (Base64 Decoded):**
```json
{
  "user": "unix-user",
  "hostname": "system-hostname", 
  "utcTimestamp": "ISO-timestamp",
  "uuid": "owner-uuid"
}
```
