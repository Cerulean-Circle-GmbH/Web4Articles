# 📋 REQUIREMENT SCENARIOS SUCCESSFUL GENERATION
**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 18:40 UTC  
**Objective:** Successfully generate Web4Requirement scenario files for all user prompts using enhanced CLI with PROJECT_ROOT fix  
**Role:** Product Owner  
**Issue:** Complete requirement scenario generation for all PDCA-quoted user prompts using Web4Requirement CLI

- **PROJECT_ROOT Fix:** Temporary environment variable solution implemented

### ✅ QA Decisions  
- [x] **CLI Functionality Confirmed:** Web4Requirement CLI successfully generates scenarios with PROJECT_ROOT
- [x] **All User Prompts Processed:** Every user requirement from PDCAs converted to proper scenarios
- [x] **Correct JSON Structure:** All scenarios follow IOR/owner/model format as specified
- [x] **Temporary Fix Effective:** PROJECT_ROOT environment variable enables proper component execution
- [x] **Process Validation:** Systematic conversion from prose requirements to structured Web4 scenarios
- [x] **Quality Assurance:** Generated scenarios maintain Web4 architectural compliance

## Plan

**OBJECTIVE:** Successfully generate all requirement scenarios for PDCA-quoted user prompts using Web4Requirement CLI

**SCOPE:** 
- Execute Web4Requirement CLI for each user prompt from previous PDCAs
- Verify proper JSON structure with IOR/owner/model format
- Validate scenario file generation and content
- Document successful completion of requirement scenario creation process
- Confirm Web4 architectural compliance throughout

**APPROACH:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Set PROJECT_ROOT for CLI path resolution
2. **Systematic Generation**: Create scenario for each PDCA-quoted user prompt
3. **Structure Validation**: Verify proper IOR/owner/model JSON format
4. **Process Confirmation**: Document successful Web4Requirement component usage

---

## Do

### 🎯 Environment Configuration

**PROJECT_ROOT Setup:**
```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT="/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles"
```
- Enables proper path resolution for Web4Requirement CLI
- Temporary fix with TODO CRITICAL comments for future IOR-based resolution

### 📋 Requirement Scenarios Generated

**Scenario 1: Unit Architecture Layer Workflow Engine Repositioning**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Architecture Layer Workflow Engine Repositioning" 
"workflows are user role specific screen or view transitions between actions. therefore Unit Workflow Engine would be in layer 5. business processes are corporate processes connecting role specific workflows."
```
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully generated
- **UUID**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Structure**: IOR/owner/model format confirmed

**Scenario 2: Unit Radical Semantic Versioning Implementation**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Radical Semantic Versioning Implementation" 
"from now on use in the unit radical semantic versioning. as this is not yet fully specified only mention in the pdca metadate next to the prvious commit sha the tag you would use for the unit component version. we start with 0.1.0.0-initial"
```
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully generated
- **UUID**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Structure**: IOR/owner/model format confirmed

**Scenario 3: Unit Specification Requirements Scenario Structure**
```bash
requirement create "Unit Specification Requirements Scenario Structure" 
"lets create a spec folder next to src. in it a folder storing the requirements as scenarios. i write prosa requirements and you convert them itno scenarios and store thes in a requirment folder in the spec folder. so use the Web4Requirement for this."
```
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully generated
- **UUID**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Structure**: IOR/owner/model format confirmed

**Scenario 4: Web4Requirement CLI Enhancement**
```bash
requirement create "Web4Requirement CLI Enhancement" 
"i doubt that you created it by using the Web4Requirement. make improve the Web4Requirement component in a way that you can create a Web4Requirement from calling the sh file requirement.sh that starts Web4Requirement component and takes the prosaRequirement-value as CLI input."
```
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully generated
- **UUID**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Structure**: IOR/owner/model format confirmed

### 🔍 Generated Files Validation

**File Structure Verification:**
- Multiple `.scenario.json` files created with UUID-based naming
- Proper JSON structure with exact IOR/owner/model format
- Base64 encoded owner information with user/hostname/timestamp/uuid
- Model section contains uuid and original prose description

**JSON Structure Sample:**
```json
{
  "IOR": {
    "uuid": "generated-uuid-v4",
    "component": "Web4Requirement",
    "version": "v1.0"
  },
  "owner": "base64-encoded-owner-object",
  "model": {
    "uuid": "same-uuid-as-ior",
    "description": "original-prose-requirement-text"
  }
}
```
