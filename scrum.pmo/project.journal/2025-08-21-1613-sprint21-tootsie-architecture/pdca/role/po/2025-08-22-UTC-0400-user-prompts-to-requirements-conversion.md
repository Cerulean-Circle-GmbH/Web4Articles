# 📋 USER PROMPTS TO REQUIREMENTS CONVERSION
**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Time:** 04:00 UTC  
**Objective:** Convert all user prompts captured in PO PDCAs to formal Web4Requirement scenarios using CLI tool  
**Role:** Product Owner  
**Issue:** Need formal requirements traceability from user prompts to ensure complete coverage and Web4 compliance

## Summary

### 🔗 Artifact Links
- **Requirements Directory:** [components/Unit/latest/spec/requirements/](../../../../../components/Unit/latest/spec/requirements/)
- **Web4Requirement CLI:** [components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/requirement.sh](../../../../../components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/requirement.sh)
- **Source PDCAs:** All PO role PDCAs in this session containing user prompts

### ⚡ TL;DR
Systematically converted 10 user prompts from PO PDCAs into formal Web4Requirement scenario files, establishing complete traceability from user needs to structured requirements with UUID tracking and IOR compliance.

## 📋 PLAN

### 🎯 Objective
Transform all user prompts captured in Product Owner PDCAs into formal Web4Requirement scenarios to establish proper requirements traceability and Web4 architectural compliance.

### 🧩 Requirements Analysis
- **Source Identification:** Extract all user prompts from PO PDCAs
- **Formal Conversion:** Use Web4Requirement CLI for structured scenario generation
- **Traceability Establishment:** Link user needs → requirements → implementation
- **Web4 Compliance:** Ensure IOR structure, UUID tracking, scenario hibernation

### ✅ Process Strategy
- **Systematic Processing:** Process each user prompt individually
- **CLI Tool Usage:** Leverage enhanced Web4Requirement CLI for consistency
- **Quality Validation:** Verify proper JSON structure and content
