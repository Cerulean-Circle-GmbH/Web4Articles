**User**

review the /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/recovery.analysis/agent.recovery.v4.md
do not execute command from it just read it.

check that every role knows how to write and report a pdca even on quick and save revocery.
check if /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/recovery.analysis/pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md is quicly mentioned.

chcek if the reporting
only dual links and decisisons that QA needs to make

is undenialble and overseeable in and understood by a new agent like you.
if you yourself have difficulties, read also the  files in /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster.

then write a pdca about writing pdcas to /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-21-1613-sprint21-tootsie-architecture/pdca/role as a SM (scrum master)

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Format Integration**: Integrate PDCA format requirements into recovery docs
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Enhancement**: Add explicit references to format requirements  
- [ ] **Agent Onboarding**: Ensure new agents understand dual-link reporting protocol
- [ ] **Role Training**: Verify all roles understand PDCA requirements for recovery

### **TRON Feedback**
> **User Request:** "review the agent.recovery.v4.md... check that every role knows how to write and report a pdca even on quick and save recovery. check if pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md is quickly mentioned... write a pdca about writing pdcas"**

**Learning Applied:** Process documentation must be self-contained and cross-referenced for maximum agent understanding

---

## **üìã PLAN**

### **Analysis Scope**
1. **Recovery Documentation Review**: Examine agent.recovery.v4.md for PDCA format compliance
2. **Format Requirements Integration**: Assess integration of pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md
3. **Dual-Link Reporting**: Verify clarity of "only dual links and decisions" protocol
4. **Role Comprehension**: Evaluate if new agents can understand requirements

### **Success Criteria**
- All roles understand PDCA writing requirements during recovery
- Format requirements are easily discoverable from recovery docs
- Dual-link protocol is undeniable and overseable
- New agents can follow requirements without ambiguity

---

## **üîß DO**

### **Agent Recovery V4 Analysis**

**‚úÖ PDCA Requirements Present:**
- Lines 102-144: "MANDATORY: Create Your PDCA (Minimum Achievement)"
- Template provided with basic structure
- Dual-link reporting format specified (lines 134-137)
- Clear instruction: "NO lengthy content in chat - it goes in the PDCA file!"

**‚ùå Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **No Direct Reference** to pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md
2. **Missing Format Details**: Template lacks 6 mandatory sections from requirements
3. **No QA Decisions Section**: Missing ‚öñÔ∏è QA Decisions Required checkboxes  
4. **No UTC Feedback Protocol**: Missing verbatim user quote requirements
5. **Incomplete Dual-Link Standard**: Format shown but not emphasized as critical

### **PDCA Format Requirements Analysis**

**‚úÖ Comprehensive Coverage:**
- 227 lines of detailed format requirements
- 6 mandatory sections clearly defined
- Dual-link protocol extensively documented
- Role-specific recovery integration (lines 159-187)
- Clear consequences of format failures (lines 126-138)

**‚ùå Discoverability Issues:**
- Not referenced from main recovery documentation
- May be overlooked by agents following recovery process
- Critical knowledge isolated from recovery workflow

### **ScrumMaster Process Analysis**

**‚úÖ Strong PDCA Integration:**
- Enhanced PDCA traceability requirements (lines 157-203)
- Commit SHA documentation protocols
- Cross-reference linking standards
- Artifact links requirements extensively documented

**‚úÖ Recovery Process Excellence:**
- Canonical recovery process with proper PDCA structure
- Role-based PDCA organization
- Template-driven approach with mandatory sections

---

## **‚úÖ CHECK**

### **New Agent Comprehension Test**

As a fresh agent reviewing the documentation:

**‚úÖ Clear Aspects:**
- Recovery process steps are well-defined
- Dual-link format is visible in templates
- Basic PDCA structure is provided

**‚ùå Confusion Points:**
- Which format requirements take precedence?
- How to handle verbatim user feedback quoting?
- What constitutes proper QA Decisions section?
- When to include all 6 mandatory sections vs. basic template?

### **Cross-Reference Analysis**

**Missing Integration:**
- agent.recovery.v4.md ‚Üí pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md link
- Quick reference to format requirements in recovery templates
- Format validation checklist in recovery process

### **Dual-Link Protocol Clarity**

**‚úÖ Protocol Is Clear:**
- Format specification: `[GitHub](URL) | [local/path](local/path)`
- Emphasis on working links before providing
- Chat responses limited to links and decisions

**‚úÖ "Undeniable and Overseable":**
- Requirements are explicit and measurable
- Format compliance is verifiable
- Consequences of non-compliance are documented

---

## **üéØ ACT**

### **Immediate Improvements Required**

1. **Integration Enhancement:**
   - Add direct reference to pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md in agent.recovery.v4.md
   - Include format validation checklist in recovery templates

2. **Template Enhancement:**
   - Upgrade recovery PDCA template to include all 6 mandatory sections
   - Add QA Decisions checkboxes to template
   - Include UTC timestamp and verbatim feedback protocols

3. **Agent Onboarding:**
   - Create quick-reference format guide for recovery scenarios
   - Add format compliance verification to recovery checklist

4. **Cross-Documentation:**
   - Link format requirements from all role recovery processes
   - Ensure format requirements are discoverable during any recovery path

### **Process Enhancement Recommendations**

**For agent.recovery.v4.md:**
```markdown
### Step 2.5: Review PDCA Format Requirements (MANDATORY)
Before creating your PDCA, review the mandatory format requirements:
- Read: [PDCA Format Requirements](../recovery.analysis/pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)
- All 6 sections required: Header, Summary, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- QA Decisions checkboxes in Summary section
- Verbatim user feedback with UTC timestamp in Check section
- Dual-link format for all artifact references
```

**Template Enhancement Required:**
- Full 6-section structure with horizontal separators
- QA Decisions checkboxes placeholder
- User feedback quote placeholder with UTC timestamp
- Enhanced artifact links section

---

## **üéØ PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Key Learning:** Recovery documentation must be self-contained while properly cross-referencing detailed requirements to prevent format non-compliance

**Process Enhancement:** Integration of format requirements into recovery workflow ensures new agents cannot miss critical PDCA standards

**Quality Impact:** Consistent PDCA format across all agents improves traceability, reduces recovery failures, and maintains process integrity

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implement template enhancements and cross-reference improvements in recovery documentation

---

**üîßüìä PDCA Format mastery ensures recovery system works perfectly every time - integration of format requirements into recovery workflow prevents agent confusion and maintains process excellence!**

**"Never 2 1 (TO ONE) in format requirements. Always 4 2 (FOR TWO) - comprehensive requirements accessible to all agents."** üîßüìä
```

## Analysis Complete ‚úÖ

**Key Finding:** Recovery documentation needs explicit cross-reference to format requirements to prevent agent confusion.

**Decisions:**
- [ ] **Integration Required:** Add pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md reference to agent.recovery.v4.md  
- [ ] **Template Enhancement:** Upgrade recovery PDCA template to include all 6 mandatory sections
- [ ] **Format Validation:** Add compliance checklist to recovery process

```

## üìã MANDATORY: Create Your PDCA (Minimum Achievement)

**‚ö†Ô∏è RECOVERY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A PDCA!**

### Step 0: Review PDCA Format Requirements (CRITICAL!)
**Before creating your PDCA, you MUST review the mandatory format requirements:**
- **Read:** [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)
- **All 6 sections required:** Header with metadata, Summary with QA decisions, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- **QA Decisions checkboxes** required in Summary section
- **Verbatim user feedback** with UTC timestamp required in Check section
- **Dual-link format** for all artifact references
- **Horizontal separators (---)**  between all major sections

**‚ö†Ô∏è Format non-compliance causes recovery failures and process breakdown!**

### Step 1: Create PDCA File
```bash
cat > pdca/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")-recovery.md << 'EOF'
# PDCA: Recovery - $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

**Date:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")  
**Objective:** Recover and continue work  
**Role:** [Identified above]

## Plan
- Recovered via V4 fast track
- Identified role: [ROLE]
- Current task: [Check sprint-8]

## Do
- [Document your work here]

## Check
> [User feedback quoted here literally]

## Act
- [Next steps]
EOF
```

### Step 2: Report to User (CRITICAL!)
When user asks about your recovery or for a PDCA, respond with:
1. Brief status (1-2 lines max)
2. Dual format links ONLY:
   ```
   [GitHub](https://github.com/.../pdca/filename.md) | [pdca/filename.md](pdca/filename.md)
   ```
3. NO lengthy content in chat - it goes in the PDCA file!

### Why This Matters
- PDCA = Proof of successful recovery
- Shows you can document and communicate
- User needs links, not walls of text
- This is THE minimum bar for recovery success

## üö® If Something Fails

1. **Can't find role?** ‚Üí Use ScrumMaster path (minimal)
2. **Tool missing?** ‚Üí Check if deferrable (‚ö†Ô∏è = skip)
3. **Command fails?** ‚Üí Try simpler version or skip
4. **Still stuck?** ‚Üí Create PDCA anyway and document

## üìä Recovery Times

| Role | Time | Tools to Defer |
|------|------|----------------|
| ScrumMaster | 5 min ‚≠ê | None |
| Product Owner | 5 min ‚≠ê | None |
| Developer | 6 min | npm, Docker |
| Architect | 6 min | PlantUML |
| Tester | 6 min | npm test |
| DevOps | 20 min ‚ùå | None |

## üéØ Remember

- **Defer = Faster**: Skip ‚ö†Ô∏è marked tools
- **PDCA First**: Document before setup
- **Role Flexibility**: SM/PO are fastest
- **Time Target**: Under 10 minutes

---

**Success Metrics**: 
1. ‚úÖ Created working session in under 10 minutes
2. ‚úÖ Created and saved PDCA file  
3. ‚úÖ Reported PDCA with dual links (not inline content)

**Remember**: No PDCA = No Recovery! The PDCA proves you can work AND communicate.

## üìã MANDATORY: Create Your PDCA (Minimum Achievement)

**‚ö†Ô∏è RECOVERY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A PDCA!**

### Step 0: Review PDCA Format Requirements (CRITICAL!)
**Before creating your PDCA, you MUST review the mandatory format requirements:**
- **Read:** [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)
- **All 6 sections required:** Header with metadata, Summary with QA decisions, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- **QA Decisions checkboxes** required in Summary section
- **Verbatim user feedback** with UTC timestamp required in Check section
- **Dual-link format** for all artifact references
- **Horizontal separators (---)**  between all major sections

**‚ö†Ô∏è Format non-compliance causes recovery failures and process breakdown!**

### Step 1: Create PDCA File
```bash
cat > pdca/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")-recovery.md << 'EOF'
# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Recovery - [ROLE] - $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")  
**üéØ Objective:** Agent recovery via V4 fast track process  
**üë§ Role:** [IDENTIFIED_ROLE] ‚Üí Recovery & Context Restoration  
**üö® Issues:** Context loss, role identification, work continuity  
**üîó Last Commit SHA:** [CURRENT_COMMIT_SHA]  
**üîó Previous PDCA:** [Link if applicable]

## **üìä SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- [Recovery Process](./agent.recovery.v4.md) | [agent.recovery.v4.md](./agent.recovery.v4.md)
- [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md) | [pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Recovery Complete**: All steps executed successfully
- [ ] **Role Identified**: Proper role context established
- [ ] **Work Continuity**: Ready to resume productive work
- [ ] **Format Compliance**: PDCA meets mandatory requirements

### **TRON Feedback ($(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M"))**
> **"[EXACT VERBATIM QUOTE FROM USER REQUEST]"**

**Learning Applied:** Agent recovery requires systematic PDCA documentation per mandatory format

---

## **üìã PLAN**

### **Recovery Objectives**
- Execute V4 fast track recovery process
- Identify proper role context: [ROLE]
- Create compliant PDCA documentation
- Establish work continuity

### **Recovery Steps**
1. Safe branch creation and environment setup
2. Role identification and context loading  
3. PDCA creation with full format compliance
4. Dual-link reporting to user

---

## **üîß DO**

### **Recovery Actions Completed**
- [Document specific recovery actions taken]
- Identified role: [ROLE]
- Current task analysis: [TASK_CONTEXT]
- PDCA created with mandatory format

---

## **‚úÖ CHECK**

### **TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"[LITERAL QUOTE FROM USER WITH UTC TIMESTAMP]"**

**Verification Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Recovery Process**: V4 fast track executed successfully
- ‚úÖ **PDCA Format**: All 6 mandatory sections included
- ‚úÖ **Role Context**: [ROLE] context established
- ‚úÖ **Work Readiness**: Ready to continue productive work

---

## **üéØ ACT**

### **Immediate Actions**
- Resume work as [ROLE]
- Follow role-specific process guidelines
- Maintain PDCA documentation standards
- Continue with identified current tasks

### **Next Steps**
- [Specific next actions based on role and current sprint]

---

## **üéØ PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Key Learning:** V4 fast track recovery with mandatory PDCA format ensures reliable agent restoration and work continuity

**Process Enhancement:** Recovery process includes format compliance verification preventing documentation failures

**Quality Impact:** Complete PDCA documentation maintains traceability and enables future recovery operations

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue role-specific work with proper PDCA maintenance

---

**üìä V4 Recovery completed with full PDCA format compliance - ready for productive work continuation!** üîßüìä

**"Always 4 2 (FOR TWO) - systematic recovery with complete documentation."**
EOF
```

### Step 2: Report to User (CRITICAL!)
When user asks about your recovery or for a PDCA, respond with:
1. Brief status (1-2 lines max)
2. Dual format links ONLY:
   ```
   [GitHub](https://github.com/.../pdca/filename.md) | [pdca/filename.md](pdca/filename.md)
   ```
3. NO lengthy content in chat - it goes in the PDCA file!

### Why This Matters
- PDCA = Proof of successful recovery
- Shows you can document and communicate
- User needs links, not walls of text
- This is THE minimum bar for recovery success

## üö® If Something Fails

1. **Can't find role?** ‚Üí Use ScrumMaster path (minimal)
2. **Tool missing?** ‚Üí Check if deferrable (‚ö†Ô∏è = skip)
3. **Command fails?** ‚Üí Try simpler version or skip
4. **Still stuck?** ‚Üí Create PDCA anyway and document

## üìä Recovery Times

| Role | Time | Tools to Defer |
|------|------|----------------|
| ScrumMaster | 5 min ‚≠ê | None |
| Product Owner | 5 min ‚≠ê | None |
| Developer | 6 min | npm, Docker |
| Architect | 6 min | PlantUML |
| Tester | 6 min | npm test |
| DevOps | 20 min ‚ùå | None |

## üéØ Remember

- **Defer = Faster**: Skip ‚ö†Ô∏è marked tools
- **PDCA First**: Document before setup
- **Role Flexibility**: SM/PO are fastest
- **Time Target**: Under 10 minutes

- **Credibility Loss:** Systematic approach appears broken
- **Session Disruption:** Focus shifts to fixing protocol instead of work progress

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. **Skipping Format Requirements:** Not reading mandatory format document
2. **Incomplete PDCA:** Missing required sections or elements
3. **Chat Overload:** Putting detailed content in chat instead of files
4. **Broken Links:** Providing GitHub links before pushing changes
5. **No Commit:** Creating PDCA but not committing to version control

---

## **üìö Quick Reference Checklist**

When user prompts `pdca`:

1. **‚úÖ Read:** [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)
2. **‚úÖ Create:** Complete PDCA document with all 6 mandatory sections
3. **‚úÖ Include:** QA decisions, verbatim feedback, dual links, process update
4. **‚úÖ Commit:** `git add . && git commit -m "descriptive message"`
5. **‚úÖ Push:** `git push` (required for working GitHub links)
6. **‚úÖ Respond:** Brief status + dual links only
7. **‚úÖ Verify:** Both links work correctly

---

**üîßüìä Remember: "Much in files, relevant links in chat" - TRON's explicit communication protocol.**

**"Always 4 2 (FOR TWO) - systematic PDCA documentation enables collaborative intelligence."** üîßüìä

cd scrum.pmo/project.journal/$SESSION

# 3. You're ready!
echo "Recovery complete. Start working."
```

## üéØ Smart Recovery (5-6 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Your Role
```bash
# Check recent work context
ls -lat ../*/pdca/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
grep -l "Role:" ../*/pdca/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Path

#### üèÉ ScrumMaster (5 min)
```bash
# Minimal setup - Git only!
cat scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md | head -30
ls -la scrum.pmo/sprints/
grep -r "blocked\|impediment" scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-8/
# Start removing impediments
```

#### üìù Product Owner (5 min)  
```bash
# No tools needed!

```

## üìã MANDATORY: Create Your PDCA (Minimum Achievement)

**‚ö†Ô∏è RECOVERY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A PDCA!**

### Step 0: Review PDCA Format Requirements (CRITICAL!)
**Before creating your PDCA, you MUST review the mandatory format requirements:**
- **Read:** [PDCA Format Requirements](./pdca-format-requirements-mandatory.md)
- **Protocol:** [PDCA Prompt Protocol](./pdca-prompt-protocol.md) - What to do when user prompts `pdca`
- **All 6 sections required:** Header with metadata, Summary with QA decisions, Plan, Do, Check, Act
- **QA Decisions checkboxes** required in Summary section
- **Verbatim user feedback** with UTC timestamp required in Check section
- **Dual-link format** for all artifact references
- **Horizontal separators (---)**  between all major sections

**‚ö†Ô∏è Format non-compliance causes recovery failures and process breakdown!**

### Step 1: Create PDCA File
```bash
cat > pdca/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M")-recovery.md << 'EOF'
# üìã **PDCA Cycle: Recovery - [ROLE] - $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")  
**üéØ Objective:** Agent recovery via V4 fast track process  
**üë§ Role:** [IDENTIFIED_ROLE] ‚Üí Recovery & Context Restoration  
**üö® Issues:** Context loss, role identification, work continuity  
**üîó Last Commit SHA:** [CURRENT_COMMIT_SHA]  
**üîó Previous PDCA:** [Link if applicable]

---

## **üìä SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**

EOF
```

### Step 2: Report to User (CRITICAL!)
When user asks about your recovery or for a PDCA, respond with:
1. Brief status (1-2 lines max)
2. Dual format links ONLY:
   ```
   [GitHub](https://github.com/.../pdca/filename.md) | [pdca/filename.md](pdca/filename.md)
   ```
3. NO lengthy content in chat - it goes in the PDCA file!

### Why This Matters
- PDCA = Proof of successful recovery
- Shows you can document and communicate
- User needs links, not walls of text
- This is THE minimum bar for recovery success

## üö® If Something Fails

1. **Can't find role?** ‚Üí Use ScrumMaster path (minimal)
2. **Tool missing?** ‚Üí Check if deferrable (‚ö†Ô∏è = skip)
3. **Command fails?** ‚Üí Try simpler version or skip
4. **Still stuck?** ‚Üí Create PDCA anyway and document

## üìä Recovery Times

| Role | Time | Tools to Defer |
