WOOOOW perfect decision format!!!
well done my friend. you learn it!!!

1a, no it was using view/html/index.html in the previous version. always look into the previous version an keep these simple things stable.
1b, no tis boots the browser versio9n of once in a othervise empty page. just one line of import ONCE otherwise the page is empty. a small centered heading at the to "ONCE <version> up and running".
no code, no functions, no scripts.

2. nice ideas for a later design system. make them future reuirements.
3. is taha a decision to do a,b or c. what do you want to tell me or ask me.
i expect testing to work.

include all of your wonderfull ideas on the health page /.  you are allowed to make it really nice and modern like suggested in 2.

good format...confusing content of the decisions. but i hope we are clear now.
pdca.
```

### **My Answer**
I followed the v0.1.0.2 routing pattern exactly as requested. The root `/` now serves a comprehensive server status page with all the beautiful design elements, while `/once` is kept minimal with just the ONCE import and heading. I created future requirements for the advanced design system ideas and ensured the s5b sequence testing works correctly.

**Learning Applied:** Always preserve proven stability patterns from previous versions - they exist for good reasons and user familiarity.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Restore routing stability by following v0.1.0.2 pattern while incorporating enhanced design elements appropriately

**Requirements Traceability:** User feedback demanding stability preservation and appropriate feature placement

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Root Path Enhancement:** Apply beautiful design system to comprehensive status page at `/`  
- **Simple Client Preservation:** Keep `/once` minimal with just ONCE import and version heading
- **Future Planning:** Create proper requirements for advanced interactive features
- **Testing Verification:** Ensure s5b sequence works with corrected routing

## **🔧 DO**

**Routing Pattern Implementation**

**1. Root Path Enhancement (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**
```typescript
if (url.pathname === '/') {
  // Root path - serve comprehensive server status page (like v0.1.0.2 view/html/index.html)
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.end(this.getServerStatusHTML());
}
```

**2. Health Endpoint Separation (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**  
```typescript
else if (url.pathname === '/health') {
  // Health endpoint - JSON status
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
  // Returns server status as JSON for API consumption
}
```

**3. Simple ONCE Client (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**
```html
<!-- Minimal /once endpoint -->
<div class="container">
    <h1>ONCE 0.2.0.0 up and running</h1>
</div>
<script type="module">
    import { ONCE } from './dist/js/layer3/ONCE.js';
</script>
```

**4. Enhanced Root Status Page (✅ CREATED)**
```html
<!-- Beautiful comprehensive status page at / -->
<!-- Features: Glassmorphism design, gradient backgrounds, server hierarchy display,
     endpoint documentation, WebSocket information, capabilities overview -->
```

**5. Future Requirements Created (✅ COMPLETED)**
- **Design System Requirement:** UUID `daa07013-b476-4d54-953c-58cdebc27b85`
- **UI Components Requirement:** UUID `dd593889-01ad-40c0-bc78-474143271118`
