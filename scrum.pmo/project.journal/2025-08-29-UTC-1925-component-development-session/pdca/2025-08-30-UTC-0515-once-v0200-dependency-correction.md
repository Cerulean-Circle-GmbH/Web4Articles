### QA Decisions
- [x] Move UUID dependencies to production dependencies section
- [x] Ensure proper dependency versions for production use
- [x] Maintain package.json best practices for Web4 components
- [x] Verify all runtime dependencies are properly declared

## Plan

**Goal:** Correct the package.json dependency configuration to ensure UUID packages are properly declared as production dependencies rather than development dependencies.

**Issue Identified:**
The UUID dependencies (`uuid` and `@types/uuid`) were needed for runtime operation in `ServerHierarchyManager.ts` but may not have been properly configured in the production dependencies section of package.json.

**User Correction Applied:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@types/uuid": "^10.0.0",
  "uuid": "^11.1.0", 
  "ws": "^8.14.2"
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Production Deployment:** Runtime dependencies must be in dependencies, not devDependencies
- **Module Resolution:** Ensures UUID packages are available during server operation
- **Package Distribution:** Proper dependency declaration for npm package publishing
- **Docker/Container Support:** Production builds need all runtime dependencies declared

**Expected Outcome:**
- Proper package.json configuration for production deployment
- All runtime dependencies correctly declared
- Consistent dependency management across Web4 components

## Do

### 1. Dependency Analysis
**Runtime Dependencies Identified:**
- **`uuid`:** Used in `ServerHierarchyManager.ts` for generating server UUIDs
- **`@types/uuid`:** TypeScript type definitions for UUID package
- **`ws`:** WebSocket server implementation for server hierarchy communication

**Usage in Code:**
```typescript
// ServerHierarchyManager.ts
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

// Used for server UUID generation
this.serverModel = {
    uuid: uuidv4(),
    // ...other properties
} as ONCEServerModel;
```

### 2. Dependency Classification
**Production Dependencies (runtime required):**
- ✅ `uuid: ^11.1.0` - Runtime UUID generation
- ✅ `@types/uuid: ^10.0.0` - TypeScript compilation and runtime type checking
- ✅ `ws: ^8.14.2` - WebSocket server functionality

**Development Dependencies (build/test only):**
- `@types/node: ^20.8.0` - Node.js type definitions for development
- `typescript: ^5.2.2` - TypeScript compiler for build process
- `vitest: ^0.34.0` - Testing framework

### 3. Package.json Correction Applied
**Before (potentially incorrect):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ws": "^8.14.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "uuid": "^11.1.0",
    "@types/uuid": "^10.0.0",
    // ... other dev deps
  }
}
```

**After (user correction):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/uuid": "^10.0.0",
    "uuid": "^11.1.0", 
    "ws": "^8.14.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.8.0",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    "vitest": "^0.34.0"
  }
}
```

### 4. Impact Assessment
**Production Deployment Benefits:**
- **Docker Builds:** `npm install --production` will include UUID packages
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Production builds will have all required dependencies
- **Package Publishing:** Consumers will automatically get runtime dependencies
- **Serverless Deployment:** Function deployments will include UUID functionality

**Development Workflow:**
- **Build Process:** TypeScript compilation has access to UUID types
- **IDE Support:** Full IntelliSense and type checking for UUID operations
- **Testing:** Runtime dependencies available during test execution

## Check

### QA Feedback
**User Action (2025-08-30 UTC 05:12):**
> Modified package.json to move uuid and @types/uuid to dependencies section

**Validation of User Correction:**
- ✅ **Proper Placement:** UUID packages correctly moved to dependencies
- ✅ **Version Consistency:** Using compatible versions (uuid ^11.1.0 with @types/uuid ^10.0.0)
- ✅ **Production Ready:** Runtime dependencies properly declared
- ✅ **TypeScript Support:** Type definitions included for development and runtime

### Dependency Verification
**Production Dependencies Check:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@types/uuid": "^10.0.0",  // ✅ Needed for TypeScript runtime type checking
  "uuid": "^11.1.0",         // ✅ Required for server UUID generation
  "ws": "^8.14.2"           // ✅ Required for WebSocket server functionality
}
```

**Runtime Usage Validation:**
- **UUID Generation:** `uuidv4()` called during server initialization
- **TypeScript Compilation:** Type definitions required for strict mode compilation
- **WebSocket Operations:** Server hierarchy communication depends on ws package

### Package.json Best Practices Compliance
**✅ Semantic Versioning:**
- Using caret ranges (^) for compatible updates
- Major version pinning prevents breaking changes
- Minor/patch updates allowed for bug fixes and features

**✅ Dependency Categories:**
- Production dependencies: Runtime requirements only
- Development dependencies: Build tools and testing frameworks
- No peer dependencies needed for this component

**✅ Package Metadata:**
- Correct version: "0.2.0.0"
- Proper name: "@web4/once"
- Valid license: "MIT"
- Appropriate scripts for build/test/start workflows
