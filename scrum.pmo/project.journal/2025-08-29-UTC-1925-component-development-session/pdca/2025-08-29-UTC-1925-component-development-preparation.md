### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Completed decision: Create new development session separate from learning session
- [x] Completed decision: Apply comprehensive learning from previous session to practical development
- [ ] **Decision 1: Component Development Focus**
  - a) Enhance existing ONCE component with new features
  - b) Create new Web4 component following learned architecture patterns
  - c) Focus on specific component type (TSRanger, Unit, etc.)
- [ ] **Decision 2: Development Approach**
  - a) Start with requirement creation and architecture planning
  - b) Begin with practical implementation and iterate
  - c) Focus on testing and validation infrastructure first

act the same way BUT
prepare to do development worlk on componetns.
```

### **My Answer**
I have created the new component development session and applied all learning from the previous comprehensive session. I understand the Web4 architecture, PDCA methodology, ONCE component system, and agent management. Now transitioning from learning specialist to component developer role, ready to create or enhance Web4 components following the learned patterns.

**Learning Applied:** Comprehensive understanding of Web4 7-layer architecture, CMMI Level 3 compliance, and component lifecycle patterns enables confident component development

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish component development environment and prepare for Web4 component creation following learned architectural patterns

**Requirements Traceability:** TBD - Will create requirement UUID based on selected component focus

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Learning Application:** Apply comprehensive Web4 architecture understanding to practical component development
- **Role Transition:** Switch from learning specialist to developer role with full architectural context
- **Component Focus:** Determine specific component development target based on project needs and decisions
