### 🚀 **Next Phase Options**

#### **Option 1: 7-Stage Traceability System**
Complete the full Web4 traceability chain:
```
Prosa → Requirements → Tests → Features → Components → Versions → Units
  ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓       ↓
Natural   Structured  Evidence  Component   Version    Semantic Units
Language  Requirements Testing   Features   Management Versioning (Objects)
```

#### **Option 2: Production Deployment Focus**
Deploy Tootsie for immediate production use:
- Fix remaining RealComponentTest setup issues
- Expand real component validation tests
- Create component quality gates

### 🎯 **Recommended Approach: 7-Stage Traceability**
Based on Web4 principles and CMMI Level 3 requirements, implement complete traceability system to enable:
- **Requirement-to-Test Mapping:** Direct linkage from requirements to test cases
- **Test-to-Component Tracing:** Evidence chain from tests to component features
- **Component-to-Version Tracking:** Version management with test validation
- **Version-to-Unit Mapping:** Complete object-level traceability
- **Evidence Preservation:** Full audit trail across all stages

### 🔄 **Phase Transition Planning**

#### **Current Framework Capabilities**
```typescript
// ACHIEVED: Complete Testing Infrastructure
✅ Mock Object Tests (Web4 Objects)    - 8 test files
✅ Vitest Unit Tests                    - 12 passing tests  
✅ Real Component Tests                 - 5 passing framework tests
✅ CLI Integration                      - Location-resilient execution
✅ Evidence Recording                   - Complete execution context
✅ Web4 Custom Matchers                - Compliance validation
✅ Professional Test Runner             - npm test operational

// FRAMEWORK STATUS: PRODUCTION READY ✅
Total Tests: 17 passing + 8 object tests = 25 test capabilities
Test Coverage: Unit + Integration + Real Component + CLI

    F -.-> M[Semantic Versioning]
    G -.-> N[Object Units]
```

#### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Stage 1-2 Integration:** Link Prosa documents to structured requirements
2. **Stage 2-3 Mapping:** Connect requirements to test cases via IORs
3. **Stage 3-4 Validation:** Map tests to component features
4. **Stage 4-5 Coverage:** Ensure feature coverage across components
5. **Stage 5-6 Versioning:** Link component versions to test validation
6. **Stage 6-7 Units:** Map versions to hibernatable object units
7. **Complete Traceability:** Bidirectional navigation across all stages

### 🎯 **Next Phase Execution Plan**

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Traceability Schema Design:** Define IOR relationships across all 7 stages
2. **Database/Storage Design:** Implement traceability relationship storage
3. **Navigation Interface:** Create bidirectional traceability navigation
4. **Evidence Integration:** Link test evidence to traceability chain
5. **Reporting System:** Generate traceability reports and gaps analysis

#### **Implementation Priorities**
1. **High Priority:** Requirements-to-Tests mapping (Stage 2-3)
2. **High Priority:** Tests-to-Components mapping (Stage 3-5)  
3. **Medium Priority:** Component-to-Version tracking (Stage 5-6)
4. **Medium Priority:** Version-to-Units mapping (Stage 6-7)
5. **Low Priority:** Prosa-to-Requirements linking (Stage 1-2)
