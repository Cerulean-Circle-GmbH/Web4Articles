- **Assessment Data:** Comprehensive component analysis from codebase search
- **Priority Matrix:** Development priorities based on component status and critical issues

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Development Priority Focus**
  - a) Critical Bug Fixes - TSRanger filter corruption and state recovery issues
  - b) Component Enhancement - ScenarioExtractor implementation from bootstrapping mode
  - c) Testing Infrastructure - Fix vitest dependencies and enable component testing
  - d) ONCE Tool Development - Implement missing ONCE CLI tools and integration

- [ ] **Decision 2: Implementation Strategy**
  - a) Sequential Priority - Fix critical bugs first, then enhance components
  - b) Parallel Development - Work on multiple components simultaneously
  - c) Test-Driven Development - Fix testing infrastructure first, then implement features
  - d) Architecture-First - Complete ScenarioExtractor architectural implementation

- [ ] **Decision 3: Extended Session Structure**
  - a) Daily Sprint Cycles - Each day focused on specific component/issue
  - b) Weekly Milestones - Major component completion per week
  - c) Issue-Based Tracking - Complete resolution of specific critical issues
  - d) Feature-Based Development - Complete features across multiple components

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish comprehensive technical development roadmap based on component assessment and critical issue analysis

**Requirements Traceability:** Component development needs identified through codebase analysis

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Critical Issue Resolution:** Address TSRanger Priority 0/1 bugs affecting system stability
- **Component Enhancement:** Implement ScenarioExtractor from bootstrapping to functional state
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Resolve vitest dependency issues across components
- **Architecture Compliance:** Ensure all components follow Web4 architectural principles

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Technical Assessment Executed**

**1. Component Status Analysis**
```
CURRENT COMPONENT LANDSCAPE:
✅ Web4TSComponent 0.1.0.0: Stable, 100% compliance, active standard
✅ Unit Component 0.1.0.0: Good foundation, future features marked @TODO/@FUTURE
🔄 ScenarioExtractor 0.1.0.0: Bootstrapping mode, architectural proposal only
❌ TSRanger: Multiple versions with critical bugs identified
⚠️ Testing Infrastructure: vitest dependencies missing across components
```

**2. Critical Issue Identification**
```
PRIORITY 0 (EMERGENCY):
- TSRanger Filter Corruption: [t][backspace][g] → "tg" instead of "g"
- TSRanger State Recovery: Corrupted state requires exit, no graceful recovery

PRIORITY 1 (HIGH):
- Prompt Update Inconsistency: Navigation doesn't always update prompt
- Filter Advancement Bug: g[tab] doesn't show methods anymore
- Filter Clearing Bugs: Various filtering issues with residue
```

**3. Development Opportunities Matrix**
```
IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES:
1. ScenarioExtractor Implementation (Bootstrapping → Functional)
2. TSRanger Critical Bug Resolution (Filter/State Issues)
3. Component Testing Infrastructure (vitest setup)
4. Unit Component Future Features (@TODO/@FUTURE items)
5. ONCE CLI Tool Development (Missing infrastructure)
```

**4. Technical Debt Assessment**
```
ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES:
- 28/38 TSRanger tests failing due to architectural problems
- Filter+advancement logic broken across versions
- Model-view consistency issues in TSRanger
- Missing test automation for component validation
```
