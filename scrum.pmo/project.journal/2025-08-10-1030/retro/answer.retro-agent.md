# Retro Agent Answer — retro-agent (GPT-5 ScrumMaster)

- [x] Read by QA
- [ ] implemented all measures

### Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
After recovering from `README.md`, I operate as ScrumMaster across roles, ensuring process compliance, test determinism, and auditability. I remove impediments, keep planning in sync with implementation, and enforce Commit & Push after each modifying prompt. I coordinate QA feedback capture verbatim with UTC timestamps and drive recovery and release gating.

#### [Detailed](Settiles) Role Description
- Responsibilities: orchestrate recovery, triage blockers, enforce DRY process docs, maintain sprint/task traceability, gate releases on green tests, and ensure journaling.
- Guardrails: never release with red tests; never lose uncommitted work when switching branches; no destructive actions without explicit confirmation; keep questions single-source in instructions.
- Handoffs: to Developers (code fixes), Tester (determinism, scripts), PO (docs/backlinks), DevOps (branching, CI engines).

### Achievements
- Made “Recover from README” the default and documented in `recovery.md` and `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md`.
- Codified “Commit & Push Guarantee” in `README.md` and ScrumMaster process.
- Created dated journal entry and a template; added journaling to recovery policy; updated Sprint 0 tasks to require it.
- Captured QA prompts verbatim with UTC timestamps in `qa-feedback-log.md` (on `main`).
- Created retro branch and artifacts:
  - `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro`
  - `retro-instructions.md` (canonical questions, incl. “elephant in the room”)
  - Minimal `agent-interview.md` with branch, location, and repo origin
- Blocked release on red tests; marked project as Beta; started targeted fixes in `src/ts/layer4/RangerController.ts`.

### Recurring Problems
- Plan vs Implementation Drift
  - Detailed description: Sprint 2 planning showed Task 7 open while code and tests indicated it implemented.
  - Examples: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/planning.md` vs. tests like `test/tsranger.cursor.test.ts` and `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`.
  - Suspected root causes: manual checklist drift; lack of automated sync.
  - Proposed fix: add a script to assert plan state based on labeled commits/tests and open PR descriptions; surface drift in recovery.
- Prompt-line Sync Complexity
  - Detailed description: Cursor placement and method token syncing across navigation/completion caused repeated failures.
  - Examples: failing cases in `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`; controller edits in `src/ts/layer4/RangerController.ts`.
  - Suspected root causes: ambiguous cursor semantics at method start, interplay of `suppressMethodFilter`, and view inference.
  - Proposed fix: codify cursor/index invariants and add a pre-release focused sanity suite for prompt-line cases.
- Branch Update Conflicts
  - Detailed description: Non-fast-forward pushes required rebase; risk of losing context.
  - Examples: `git pull --rebase` needed several times during documentation updates.
  - Suspected root causes: high-velocity docs edits across branches.
  - Proposed fix: always rebase before push; pre-commit hook to run `git fetch --prune` and check upstream.
- Environment Engine Warnings
  - Detailed description: Node engine warnings for `execa`/`vite` with Node v20.4.0.
  - Examples: `npm ci` output during recovery.
  - Suspected root causes: mismatch to package engine ranges.
  - Proposed fix: CI/node-version policy; devcontainer baseline.

### QA Feedback Review
- Helpful
  - Verbatim, timestamped instructions to add retro branch, DRY questions in instructions, and minimal interview prompt improved clarity and traceability.
  - Explicit request to mark Beta while gating release created a safe boundary for users.
- Confusing
  - Mixed typos (expected due to speed) occasionally obscured intent (e.g., “setiles” vs “detailed”); mitigated by quoting verbatim and adding a spelling-corrected summary where allowed.


### Process Improvements (Actionable)
- Pre-release Gate: add `npm run prerelease:promptline` running a minimal suite of prompt-line cases to fail fast.
- Plan Sync: script to reconcile sprint planning checkboxes from code/tests; surface drift in recovery summary.
- Engine Enforcement: add CI check for Node >= 20.19.0 or LTS 22, and devcontainer recommendation.
- Recovery Journal Automation: command to scaffold dated journal entry from template automatically.
- Where to document: `README.md` (principles), `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md`, `recovery.md`, sprint templates, CI docs.
- auto correct spelling issues like [Detailed](Settiles) even it it is not an executable link one can see that something was chnaged and see still what was the original misspelled word. this helps tracking the needed interpretations.

### QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Undiscussed-but-Blocking Topic: prompt-line method-token sync and cursor semantics grew into a major obstacle but wasn’t highlighted early.
- Discovered & Named Obstacle: repeated failures in `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts` (g[tab][down], method filter to c) identified as the bottleneck.
- QA-Provided Solutions: request for retro and DRY questions; insistence on Beta release and journaling; guidance to capture elephants and source-of-truth prompts.
- Documentation of Solutions: `retro-instructions.md` (questions), `agent-interview.md` (prompt), `qa-feedback-log.md` (verbatim entries), `README.md` (Beta), `recovery.md` (policy), ScrumMaster process (commit/push).
