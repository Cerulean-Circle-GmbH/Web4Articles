# Retro Agent Answer — DevcontainerCartographer (GPT-5 ScrumMaster)

### Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
After recovering from `README.md`, I act as a ScrumMaster specializing in reproducible environments and traceable delivery. I ensure recovery is autonomous, planning is canonical, and execution remains test-driven and non-interactive.

#### [Detailed](./answer.DevcontainerCartographer.md#typo:Settiles) Role Description
- Responsibilities: codify devcontainer specs, enforce ESM/TypeScript discipline, keep planning (MAIN/SUBTASK) in sync with code, and gate merges on green tests.
- Guardrails: no Jest; no CJS; no unreviewed environment drift; no destructive actions; DRY documentation.
- Handoffs: DevOps (devcontainer + CI validation), Developer/Tester (scripted tests), PO (docs/README), ScrumMaster (sprint planning and recovery logs).

### Achievements
- Sprint 4 planning and traceability
  - Added MAIN Task and subtasks for the devcontainer effort with UUID requirements.
  - Evidence: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/planning.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/requiremnents.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/task-1.md`, `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-4/task-1.1-architect-devcontainer-spec.md` … `task-1.6-scrummaster-ci-validate-devcontainer.md`.
- Index and recovery updates
  - Updated index date and added Sprint 4 entries; appended a recovery note.
  - Evidence: `index.md`, `recovery.md`.
- Test execution and environment verification
  - Installed dev deps and ran the suite; identified 4 failing prompt-line tests for follow-up.
  - Evidence: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts` failures; `package.json` scripts.
- Branch hygiene for PR
  - Pushed `feat/sprint-4-devcontainer-planning-pr` branch for PR creation.
  - Evidence: branch exists on origin (compare link).

### Recurring Problems
- Large accidental artifacts blocking pushes
  - Description: core dump (`/workspace/core`, 128MB) entered history and blocked push via GitHub size limit.
  - Examples: push errors (GH001); local file found at `/workspace/core`.
  - Root cause: stray core dump not ignored; added during planning commit.
  - Proposed fix: add `core` and `*.core` to `.gitignore`; verify before push; avoid committing non-source artifacts.
- Prompt-line test flakiness/semantics
  - Description: selection→prompt token sync scenarios (`g[tab][down]`, `g[tab]c`) intermittently red.
  - Examples: `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts` failing cases.
  - Root cause: unclear invariants for cursor and tokenization under navigation.
  - Proposed fix: document invariants; add focused sanity tests; gate PRs with a minimal subset.
- Plan vs. implementation drift
  - Description: sprint checklists occasionally diverge from code/test reality.
  - Evidence: prior S2 items vs. TUI tests.
  - Proposed fix: generate plan-state from tests/commits; surface drift in `recovery.md`.

### QA Feedback Review
- Helpful
  - Concrete, timestamped prompts (retro branch, journaling, planning) improved traceability and autonomy.
- Confusing
  - Occasional typos/short phrasing (anchors like `#typo:Settiles`) required inference; mitigated by linking to canonical instructions and preserving headings.

### Process Improvements (Actionable)
- Pre-PR sanity suite for prompt-line behavior (fast subset) and environment checks.
- Devcontainer-first workflow: standardize Node/PlantUML/Graphviz; document in `README.md` + `scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md`.
- Plan-state reconciliation script that annotates `recovery.md` and updates `index.md`.
- Push hygiene checklist: reject oversized/untracked artifacts; verify `.gitignore` coverage.

### QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Undiscussed obstacle: environment variance causing push/test friction (core dump, Node engine warnings) wasn’t explicitly framed early.
- Named obstacle: prompt-line token/cursor semantics; surfaced by failing scripted tests.
- Solutions: devcontainer standardization (Sprint 4) and explicit invariants + sanity suite for prompt-line behavior.
