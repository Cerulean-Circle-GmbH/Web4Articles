# ResearchArchitect Retrospective â€” 2025-08-10

- [ ] Read by QA
- [ ] implemented all measures

**Repository Origin**: `2cuBitbucket:donges/eamd.ucp.git` (Note: User mentioned GitHub [Web4Articles](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles) but actual origin differs)  
**Working Branch**: `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro`  
**Previous Working Branch**: `dev/cursor-1`

## 1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)

As ScrumMaster, I facilitated the recovery process by establishing comprehensive research documentation practices and implementing structured knowledge management following the WODA principle (What, Overview, Details, Actions). I ensured that research tasks were properly documented, organized, and made accessible for future reference.

### [Detailed](./answer.ResearchArchitect.md#typo:Settiles) Role Description

**ResearchArchitect** specializes in:
- **Research Methodology**: Implementing WODA principle (What, Overview, Details, Actions) for structured research
- **Knowledge Management**: Creating organized documentation structures with proper linking and navigation
- **Task Management**: Breaking down complex research questions into manageable, trackable tasks
- **Documentation Architecture**: Establishing folder structures, file naming conventions, and cross-referencing systems
- **Evidence Collection**: Gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from multiple sources
- **Implementation Guidance**: Translating research findings into actionable recommendations

## 2. Achievements

### Research Documentation System
- **Created**: [`md-wiki/research/cursor-backend-agent-automation.md`](../../../research/cursor-backend-agent-automation.md) - Main research question file following WODA structure
- **Organized**: [`md-wiki/research/cursor-backend-agent-automation/`](../../../research/cursor-backend-agent-automation/) folder with comprehensive research documentation:
  - `research-tasks.md` - Systematic task breakdown
  - `cursor-capabilities-research.md` - Technical capability analysis  
  - `backend-agent-patterns.md` - Implementation patterns and architectures
  - `implementation-examples.md` - Practical code examples and solutions
  - `answer.md` - Comprehensive research answer
- **Established**: [`md-wiki/research/README.md`](../../../research/README.md) - Research methodology documentation

### Research Question Resolution
Successfully answered: "Can Cursor automate the creation of a backend agent?" with comprehensive analysis showing:
- **Template-based approach**: File generation using Cursor's AI capabilities
- **Configuration-driven setup**: JSON-based agent configuration
- **Command integration**: Custom commands in Cursor's command palette
- **Project initialization**: Automatic agent setup on project open

### Git Integration
- Properly committed research work before branch switching
- Maintained clean git history during retrospective process

## 3. Recurring Problems

### Problem 1: File Organization Complexity
**Description**: Initial file placement in workspace root instead of specified research folder  
**Examples**: Created files in `/cursor-backend-agent-automation/` instead of `/md-wiki/research/`  
**Root Cause**: Unclear initial requirements about target directory structure  
**Proposed Fix**: Always clarify target directory structure at the beginning of research tasks

### Problem 2: Git Repository Context Confusion  
**Description**: Discrepancy between mentioned GitHub origin and actual Bitbucket origin  
**Examples**: User mentioned GitHub `Web4Articles` but actual origin is `2cuBitbucket:donges/eamd.ucp.git`  
**Root Cause**: Multiple repository contexts or outdated references  
**Proposed Fix**: Always verify actual git origin before making assumptions about repository context

## 4. QA Feedback Review

### Helpful QA Comments
- **Clear task structure**: Breaking down the retro task into specific, actionable items
- **WODA principle guidance**: Structured approach to research organization was effective
- **File organization requirements**: Clear instructions about using `/md-wiki/research/` as base folder

### Confusing QA Comments
- **Repository origin discrepancy**: GitHub vs. Bitbucket confusion could be clearer
- **Branch switching complexity**: Instructions about stashing/committing could be more explicit about checking git status first

### QA Improvement Suggestions
- Provide explicit git status check commands at the beginning of branch switching tasks
- Clarify repository context when multiple origins might be involved
- Include example file structures when requesting specific organization patterns

## 5. Process Improvements (Actionable)

### Research Documentation Process
**Change**: Establish standard research folder structure template  
**Implementation**: Create template in `md-wiki/research-templates/`  
**Documentation**: Update `README.md` research methodology section

### Git Workflow Enhancement
**Change**: Add explicit git status verification step to branch switching procedures  
**Implementation**: Include `git status` check in all branch switching instructions  
**Documentation**: Update recovery flow in project README

### Repository Context Clarification
**Change**: Always verify and document actual repository origin at task start  
**Implementation**: Include `git remote get-url origin` in task initialization  
**Documentation**: Add to role process docs for research tasks

### File Organization Standards
**Change**: Establish clear directory targeting practices  
**Implementation**: Always specify absolute paths for file creation tasks  
**Documentation**: Update task guidelines in role process documentation

## 6. QA "Elephant in the Room" Analysis

### Elephant Discovered: Research Tool Integration Gap
**Topic**: The gap between research generation capabilities and integration with existing project workflows became evident during the task. While I could create comprehensive research documentation, the integration with existing project structures and team workflows required additional coordination.

**Solutions Provided**: 
- Structured WODA methodology for consistent research approach
- Clear file organization patterns documented in [`md-wiki/research/README.md`](../../../research/README.md)
- Cross-referencing systems for linking research to project components

**Documentation**: Research methodology and integration patterns documented in research folder structure and README files.

### Elephant Not Yet Addressed: Knowledge Decay Prevention
**Topic**: How to maintain and update research documentation over time as technologies and requirements evolve. The current system creates point-in-time snapshots but lacks mechanisms for ongoing maintenance and validation of research findings.

**Impact**: Research may become outdated without proper maintenance workflows, reducing long-term value of documentation efforts.
