# Retro Agent Answer — PromptlineConductor (GPT-5 ScrumMaster)

### Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
After recovering from `README.md`, I operate as a ScrumMaster focused on deterministic CLI UX and auditability. I orchestrate recovery, enforce commit/push discipline, and keep planning synchronized with implementation. I ensure testable, non-interactive workflows for shells and TypeScript CLIs.

#### Settiles Role Description
- Responsibilities: drive autonomous recovery from `README.md`, codify repeatable shell/CLI tooling, maintain sprint/task traceability, and gate releases on green tests.
- Guardrails: never release with red tests; never destroy uncommitted work; prefer additive edits; preserve single-source-of-truth docs.
- Handoffs: Dev (TSRanger/TSCompletion changes), QA (scripted tests), PO (docs/backlinks), DevOps (branching/devcontainer).

### Achievements
- Recovery and journaling
  - Added timestamped recovery entries in `recovery.md` and created dated journal entries under `scrum.pmo/project.journal/`.
  - Evidence: `recovery.md`, `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-10-0854/project.state.md`.
- Indexing and link hygiene
  - Regenerated `index.md` with linked entries and roles; performed link checks (branch-local tooling).
  - Evidence: `index.md`.
- Test and environment verification
  - Ran `npm ci` and full test suite; captured failing cases in `test/oosh-completion.shell.test.ts` and `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`.
  - Evidence: `test/oosh-completion.shell.test.ts`, `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`.
- Retro participation
  - Created this answer on branch `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro` per `retro-instructions.md`.

### Recurring Problems
- Plan vs. implementation drift
  - Description: Sprint 2 checkboxes diverged from tested behavior (prompt-line features partly implemented while marked open).
  - Examples: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/planning.md` vs. tests under `test/tsranger.*`.
  - Root cause: manual checklist maintenance without automated reconciliation.
  - Proposed fix: script to assert plan state from tests/commits; surface drift in recovery summary.
- Prompt-line method-token sync
  - Description: Keeping prompt tokens and selection in sync through navigation requires clarified invariants.
  - Examples: failures in `g[tab][down]` and `g[tab]c` flows in `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts`.
  - Root cause: ambiguous cursor semantics combined with filter derivation.
  - Proposed fix: document cursor/index invariants and add a focused pre-release sanity suite.
- Shell compatibility pitfalls
  - Description: Bash-only constructs (`mapfile`, array semantics) in `src/sh/oosh-completion.sh` caused failures in non-bash or constrained shells.
  - Examples: errors reported during `oosh-completion.shell` tests.
  - Root cause: reliance on Bash features without guards.
  - Proposed fix: refactor to POSIX-compatible patterns; guard unset arrays; provide test coverage.

### QA Feedback Review
- Helpful
  - Verbatim, timestamped QA prompts (e.g., journaling, retro branch usage) improved traceability.
  - Guidance to keep DRY sources (questions in `retro-instructions.md`) reduced duplication.
- Confusing
  - Typos and quick phrasing sometimes obscured intent; quoting verbatim with a clarifying summary mitigated this.

### Process Improvements (Actionable)
- Pre-release gate: `npm run prerelease:promptline` with a minimal set of prompt-line tests to fail fast.
- Plan-sync script: reconcile sprint checkboxes from tests/commits; output into recovery.
- Engine baseline: standardize Node/devcontainer versions; document in `README.md` and role `process.md`.
- Recovery journal automation: standard command to scaffold dated entries from a template.
- Documentation targets: `README.md` (principles), `recovery.md`, `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md`, sprint templates, CI docs.

### QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Undiscussed obstacle: prompt-line token/cursor semantics became a major source of flakiness but lacked early, explicit framing.
- Named obstacle: failures around method-token sync in `test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts` identified as central.
- Solutions: enforce pre-release sanity suite, codify invariants, and keep plan/tests synchronized via automation.
