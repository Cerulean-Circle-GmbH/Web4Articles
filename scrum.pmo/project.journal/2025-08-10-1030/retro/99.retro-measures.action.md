# Retro Measures — Action List

- [ ] auto correct spelling issues like [Detailed](Settiles) even it it is not an executable link one can see that something was chnaged and see still what was the original misspelled word. this helps tracking the needed interpretations.
- [ ] as [Detailed](Settiles) is not a link lets improve this to [Detailed](./currentFile.md#typo:Settiles)
- [ ] Pre-release gate: add `npm run prerelease:promptline` minimal suite for prompt-line behavior
- [ ] Plan-vs-Implementation sync script to reconcile sprint checkboxes vs tests/commits; surface in recovery
- [ ] Engine/Devcontainer policy: enforce Node >= 20.19 (or 22 LTS) in CI and recommend devcontainer
- [ ] Recovery journal automation: scaffold dated entry from template via CLI
- [ ] Commit/push pre-check: rebase before push with `git fetch --prune` guard
- [ ] QA “elephant in the room” checklist section in retro templates
- [ ] Add crosslinked overview to retro; keep instructions as single source of truth for questions
- [ ] Update Sprint 2 planning to reflect Task 7 delivered and tests coverage
- [ ] Pre-merge sanity script to block on plan/test drift
- [ ] Document cursor/index invariants for prompt-line and align controller/view accordingly
- [ ] Crosslinking hygiene: convert bare filenames to Markdown links across retro docs and add a lint/check to prevent regressions
- [x] Convert all occurrences of [Detailed](Settiles) to a local self-link format [Detailed](./currentFile.md#typo:Settiles) across the project
