# Retro Measures — Action List

- [ ] Pre-release gate: add `npm run prerelease:promptline` minimal suite for prompt-line behavior
- [ ] Plan-vs-Implementation sync script to reconcile sprint checkboxes vs tests/commits; surface in recovery
- [ ] Engine/Devcontainer policy: enforce Node >= 20.19 (or 22 LTS) in CI and recommend devcontainer
- [ ] Recovery journal automation: scaffold dated entry from template via CLI
- [ ] Commit/push pre-check: rebase before push with `git fetch --prune` guard
- [ ] QA “elephant in the room” checklist section in retro templates
- [ ] Add crosslinked overview to retro; keep instructions as single source of truth for questions
- [ ] Update Sprint 2 planning to reflect Task 7 delivered and tests coverage
- [ ] Pre-merge sanity script to block on plan/test drift
- [ ] Document cursor/index invariants for prompt-line and align controller/view accordingly
