# Retro Measures — Action List

- [ ] auto correct spelling issues like [Detailed](Settiles) even it it is not an executable link one can see that something was chnaged and see still what was the original misspelled word. this helps tracking the needed interpretations.
- [ ] as [Detailed](Settiles) is not a link lets improve this to [Detailed](./currentFile.md#typo:Settiles)
- [ ] Pre-release gate: add `npm run prerelease:promptline` minimal suite for prompt-line behavior
- [ ] Plan-vs-Implementation sync script to reconcile sprint checkboxes vs tests/commits; surface in recovery
- [ ] Engine/Devcontainer policy: enforce Node >= 20.19 (or 22 LTS) in CI and recommend devcontainer
- [ ] Recovery journal automation: scaffold dated entry from template via CLI
- [ ] Commit/push pre-check: rebase before push with `git fetch --prune` guard
- [ ] QA “elephant in the room” checklist section in retro templates
- [ ] Add crosslinked overview to retro; keep instructions as single source of truth for questions
- [ ] Update Sprint 2 planning to reflect Task 7 delivered and tests coverage
- [ ] Pre-merge sanity script to block on plan/test drift
- [ ] Document cursor/index invariants for prompt-line and align controller/view accordingly
- [ ] Crosslinking hygiene: convert bare filenames to Markdown links across retro docs and add a lint/check to prevent regressions
- [x] Convert all occurrences of [Detailed](Settiles) to a local self-link format [Detailed](./currentFile.md#typo:Settiles) across the project

## Common Themes from Agent Retrospectives

Based on review of 13 agent retrospectives, the following recurring themes emerged:

### Technical Issues
- **TypeScript ESM Configuration**: Nearly all agents reported ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION errors
- **Test Timing/Determinism**: TSRanger prompt-line tests frequently flaky, requiring retries
- **Shell Compatibility**: Bash-specific constructs breaking in other shells (POSIX compliance needed)

### Process Issues
- **Plan vs Implementation Drift**: Sprint checkboxes not matching actual delivery status
- **Layer Architecture Violations**: Classes placed in wrong layers (model/view/controller)
- **Recovery Complexity**: Agents struggling to rebuild full context after recovery

### Documentation Issues
- **Unclear Requirements**: Initial task descriptions lacking specificity
- **Missing Context**: "Elephant in the room" concepts introduced without explanation
- **Cross-linking Gaps**: Bare filenames instead of proper Markdown links

## Additional Action Items from Synthesis

- [ ] Create TypeScript ESM troubleshooting guide with standard invocation patterns
- [ ] Implement test retry infrastructure with exponential backoff for timing-sensitive tests
- [ ] Add layer architecture diagram showing explicit responsibilities (layer2=model, layer4=controller, layer5=view)
- [ ] Develop automated sprint status verification script comparing plan checkboxes to git/test state
- [ ] Establish POSIX-compliant shell scripting guidelines and linter
- [ ] Create role-specific recovery checklists in each `scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md`
- [ ] Implement agent context size monitoring and warning system
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for cross-link validation and spelling checks
- [ ] Document git submodule integration strategy for articles/tools
- [ ] Create template for clear, actionable task specifications
