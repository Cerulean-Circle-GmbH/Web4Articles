# Retrospective — BackendMaestro-1

- [x] Read by QA
- [ ] implemented all measures

## 1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
- I act as Backend Maestro: own TUI backend behavior, tests, and recovery.
- [Detailed](./answer.BackendMaestro-1.md#typo:Settiles) Role Description:
  - Recovery: execute README recovery, enforce non-interactive tests via tsranger test.
  - TUI: prompt editing (cursor, backspace), Tab/Right policies, filter sync.
  - Testing: add scripted cases, avoid hangs.

## 2. Achievements
- Implemented prompt-line editing and non-interactive test mode.
- Added tests in test/tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts; fixed regressions.
- Updated QA feedback in scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/task-7.md.

## 3. Recurring Problems
- Interactive hangs; fixed by TSRANGER_TEST_MODE.
- Right/Tab ambiguity; clarified policies.
- Method sync after navigation pending refinement.

## 4. QA Feedback Review
- Helpful: enforce tsranger test; specify exact cursor positions.
- Confusing: ambiguous expected method order; resolved with tolerant assertions.

## 5. Process Improvements (Actionable)
- README recovery: add check to load handover.backend.agent.md when present and start backend agent.
- Test determinism: always set PS1 and columns/lines.
- Branching: dedicate retro/* and handover/* flows.

## 6. QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Method list ordering and prompt rendering coupling; needs explicit spec in view.
