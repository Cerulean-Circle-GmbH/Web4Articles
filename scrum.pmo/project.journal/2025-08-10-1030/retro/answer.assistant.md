# Assistant Retrospective — 2025-08-10

- [x] Read by QA
- [ ] implemented all measures

## 1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
### [Detailed](Settiles) Role Description
As ScrumMaster, I ensured recovery from `README.md` established the core principles: ESM-only, positional-args-only CLI, traceable documentation, and reproducible environment. I facilitated:
- Enforcing first-line backlinks across markdown
- UUID-based traceability for MAIN/SUBTASK tasks
- PlantUML validation and SVG artifact embedding
- Environment verification and devcontainer planning

## 2. Achievements
- Fixed PlantUML class diagrams and rendered SVGs; embedded in docs (see `docs/puml/` and `src/puml/*.puml`).
- Improved `TSRanger` stability and features (Alt+Q exit, test mode). Files: `src/ts/layer4/RangerController.ts`, `src/ts/layer5/RangerView.ts`.
- Made `GitScrumProject` dry-run testable; added `Logger`-based test. Files: `src/ts/layer2/GitScrumProject.ts`, `test/gitscrumproject.createTemplateRepo.test.ts`.
- Normalized Sprint 2 planning and tasks to PO template with Traceability sections. Files: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-2/*.md`.

## 3. Recurring Problems
### 3.1 Backlink and traceability inconsistencies
- Examples: Sprint 2 tasks missing backlinks/traceability
- Root cause: No single enforced template
- Fix: Updated PO/ScrumMaster process and mass edits

### 3.2 Diagram rendering ambiguity
- Examples: `GitScrumProject_TemplateAndRelease.puml` misread as sequence
- Root cause: compact syntax and missing skinparams
- Fix: Expand to multiline, add `skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0`, use `-checkonly`

### 3.3 Environment drift
- Examples: `plantuml`/`gh` missing
- Root cause: local setup variance
- Fix: DevOps checklist + devcontainer sprint planning

## 4. QA Feedback Review
- Helpful: Requests to see PlantUML errors in console; push for UUID bidirectional links
- Confusing: Mixed naming (“Task 8” vs `task-1.7`) clarified by MAIN/SUBTASK policy

## 5. Process Improvements (Actionable)
- Enforce Traceability placement right after Status in all tasks
- Remove subtask sub-states and subtask-owned Subtasks sections
- Place Priority under MAIN tasks; eliminate `SUBTASKS:` labels
- Update recovery to assert environment tools (Docker, Node, PlantUML, Graphviz, gh)

## 6. QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Underspecified traceability policies delayed consistent linking; addressed with PO process updates and Sprint 0 requirements (`scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-0/requiremnents.md`).
