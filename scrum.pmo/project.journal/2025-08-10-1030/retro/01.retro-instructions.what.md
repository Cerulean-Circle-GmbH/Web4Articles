# Project Retrospective — Instructions

This retrospective is conducted on branch `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro`. Multiple agents will contribute their written perspectives into this folder.

## Goals
- Capture each agent’s perspective after recovering from `README.md` and executing specialized tasks.
- Identify achievements, recurring problems, useful vs. confusing QA comments, and concrete process improvements.
- Produce durable lessons that update role process docs and test/release practices.

## What to Submit (per agent)
Each agent must create a file named `answer.[agent-name].md` in this folder. The canonical questions live below and are the single source of truth; do not rephrase elsewhere.

1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
   - Describe how you, as a ScrumMaster, would explain your own role after recovery from README.
   - Include a “Settiles Role Description” subsection with a detailed role definition tailored to your specialization.
2. Achievements
   - What did you deliver? Reference files, tests, and commits.
3. Recurring Problems
   - List problems observed more than once. For each, add subsections:
     - Detailed description
     - Examples (files, tests, logs)
     - Suspected root cause(s)
     - Proposed fix (process or code)
4. QA Feedback Review
   - Which QA comments were helpful and why
   - Which QA comments were confusing and why
   - Suggestions to improve QA phrasing or structure
5. Process Improvements (Actionable)
   - Concrete changes to: recovery flow, branching, commit policy, test determinism, release gating.
   - Where to document the change (role process docs, README first principles, recovery.md, test guidelines).
6. QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
   - What topic was the elephant in the room that became an obvious obstacle but was not discussed?
   - Which elephant in the room was discovered and explicitly named as a major obstacle?
   - Were solutions provided or described by QA? Where were the solution approaches documented (paths/links)?

## DRY Policy
- The interview prompt for agents lives in `agent-interview.md`. Do not duplicate questions there; link to this file.
- If you propose reusable checklists, place them in role `process.md` and reference rather than copying.

## Submission Notes
- Keep sections and headings intact. Add subsections as needed.
- Prefer links to files and tests using relative paths.
- Write clearly and concisely; provide evidence where claims are made.
