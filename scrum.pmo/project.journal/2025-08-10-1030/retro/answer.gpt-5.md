[Back to Retro Instructions](./retro-instructions.md)

# GPT-5 Retrospective — 2025-08-10

## 1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)
### Settiles Role Description
As ScrumMaster, after recovering from `../../../../README.md`, I ensure the team operates strictly by the project’s first principles: ESM-only TypeScript, positional-args-only CLI, shell-only file renames, radical OOP, and DRY documentation. I autonomously re-establish context, verify the DevOps environment, and communicate project state and next actions without asking for confirmation.

My specialization is documentation/process rigor for multi-agent collaboration:
- Enforce first-line backlinks across markdown pages for navigability
- Keep questions canonical in `./retro-instructions.md`; link instead of duplicating (DRY)
- Prepare branch hygiene for agent contributions on `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro`
- Verify local tooling or prefer a devcontainer path when gaps exist

## 2. Achievements
- Switched safely to branch `retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro` and prepared the retro workspace
  - Evidence: this file `./answer.gpt-5.md` on that branch
- Respected DRY by referencing `./retro-instructions.md` and `./agent-interview.md` instead of copying
- Aligned with recovery guidance by consulting `../../../../README.md#recovery` and `../../../../README.md#optimized-recovery-procedure`
- Maintained backlink policy as the first line of this page

## 3. Recurring Problems
### 3.1 Local tooling gaps during recovery
- Detailed description: Shell tools like ripgrep were missing locally, breaking convenience searches.
- Examples (logs): `zsh: command not found: rg`
- Suspected root cause(s): Assumed dev tooling installed; no fallback path defined.
- Proposed fix: Prefer POSIX `find`/`grep` as default; document `rg` as optional. Provide a devcontainer that standardizes tools.

### 3.2 DRY risks in documentation
- Detailed description: Questions appear in multiple files (instructions and interview prompt) and can drift.
- Examples: `./retro-instructions.md` and `./agent-interview.md` both mention the same action. DRY policy in `../../../../README.md` mandates a single source of truth.
- Suspected root cause(s): Convenience duplication for onboarding.
- Proposed fix: Keep canonical questions only in `./retro-instructions.md`; other pages link to it. Add a CI/docs check for duplicates.

### 3.3 Navigation/backlink consistency
- Detailed description: Not all pages consistently place backlinks at the very top.
- Examples: Mixed patterns across docs in similar projects; this file follows the policy explicitly.
- Suspected root cause(s): No enforced template.
- Proposed fix: A markdown linter rule or pre-commit hook to assert first-line backlink to the parent index/instructions.

## 4. QA Feedback Review
- Helpful: README’s recovery rule to act autonomously without asking for confirmation; it reduces stall time and clarifies responsibility.
- Helpful: Emphasis on DRY and positional-args-only CLI—prevents ambiguity in tooling and documentation.
- Confusing: The term “Settiles Role Description” appears to be a typo; clarified here as the specialization subsection while preserving the heading for consistency with instructions.

## 5. Process Improvements (Actionable)
- Recovery flow: Add a fallback search mode (POSIX `find`/`grep`) and clearly list optional tools.
- Branching: Maintain a dedicated `retro/*` namespace for multi-agent submissions with simple, consistent commit messages.
- Commit policy: Reference relative paths and branch in commit bodies; keep messages imperative.
- Test determinism: When code introduces tests, favor Vitest with ESM and a seedable RNG/config to avoid flakes (per README principles).
- Release gating: Introduce a docs lint step for backlinks/DRY before merging retro outcomes.
- Documentation location: Update README “Optimized Recovery Procedure” and add a short checklist under `scrum.pmo/` for retro submissions.

## 6. QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Not discussed but blocking: Environment determinism. Missing common tools (e.g., `rg`) hinder recovery speed.
- Explicitly named obstacle: The README’s DevOps verification implies devcontainer standardization is needed but not yet delivered.
- Solutions described by QA/docs: See `../../../../README.md#devcontainer-cross-platform` and the recovery steps under `../../../../README.md#optimized-recovery-procedure` for the plan to standardize tooling and automate checks.
