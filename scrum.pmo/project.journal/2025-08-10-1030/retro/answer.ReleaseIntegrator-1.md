# ReleaseIntegrator-1 Retrospective — 2025-08-10

- [ ] Read by QA
- [ ] implemented all measures

## 1. Role Description After Recovery (as ScrumMaster)

After recovering from `README.md`, I operate as a ScrumMaster specialized in safe branch integration. I coordinate merges, protect canonical docs (journals, templates, QA logs, workflows), and ensure cross-references and backlinks remain intact. I prefer partial, low-risk merges and follow with PRs for contested changes.

### [Detailed](./answer.ReleaseIntegrator-1.md#typo:Settiles) Role Description
- Responsibilities: plan partial merges, preserve protected paths, enforce backlink/cross-link hygiene, and document branch state in project journals.
- Guardrails: never delete journals/templates/QA logs/workflows without explicit decision; prefer rebase-before-push; keep merges auditable.
- Handoffs: DevOps (branch policies/CI checks), Developer (conflict fixes), PO (docs updates), Tester (post-merge validation).

## 2. Achievements
- Journal recovery:
  - Restored missing project journals to `main` and `release/dev` with explicit branch links:
    - [`scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-10-1030/project.state.md`](../2025-08-10-1030/project.state.md)
    - [`scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-10-0854/project.state.md`](../2025-08-10-0854/project.state.md)
- Process sync to `main` (pre-QA approved):
  - [`README.md`](../../../../README.md)
  - Role processes under `scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md` and [`scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md`](../../roles/ScrumMaster/recovery-process.md)
- Partial safe merge of `origin/feature/analyze-ranger` into `release/dev` (A/M only; no deletions; protected paths excluded).
  - Added components READMEs and architecture docs; maintained workflows and journals.

## 3. Recurring Problems
### 3.1 Journal drift and accidental deletions
- Description: feature branch removed journal files; downstream branches missed state snapshots.
- Examples: deletions of `project.state.md` under `scrum.pmo/project.journal/**` in feature branch.
- Root cause: large-scale refactor with broad deletes; missing CI guard for canonical paths.
- Proposed fix: CI rule to block deletions under `scrum.pmo/project.journal/**`, templates, and QA logs.

### 3.2 Protected workflow removal
- Description: feature branch removed `.github/workflows/**` automations.
- Examples: `auto-merge-release-dev.yml`, `eod-merge.yml`, `quality-checks.yml` dropped.
- Root cause: restructuring without path protection and PR checks.
- Proposed fix: codeowners + CI protection for workflows; require approvals.

### 3.3 Cross-link/backlink inconsistencies
- Description: newly added docs missed first-line backlinks or proper relative links.
- Examples: several `docs/**` and `scrum.pmo/**` pages lacked top backlink.
- Root cause: manual merges without post-pass checks.
- Proposed fix: pre-commit/backlink linter; post-merge doc hygiene sweep.

## 4. QA Feedback Review
- Helpful:
  - Clear directive to import non-conflicting files first and protect journals/workflows.
  - Instruction to enrich journals with explicit branch links for recoverability.
- Confusing:
  - Mixed requests across branches (main vs release/dev) required careful confirmation before pushes.

## 5. Process Improvements (Actionable)
- CI protections:
  - Block deletions under `.github/workflows/**`, `scrum.pmo/project.journal/**`, `scrum.pmo/templates/**`, `qa-feedback-log.md`.
  - Backlink/cross-link linter for changed `.md` files.
- PR discipline:
  - Rebase-before-push; open PRs for deletions; partial merges first; conflict fixes in follow-ups.
- Journal policy:
  - Every new retro or branch-work session must add/update `project.state.md` with explicit branch links and cross-linked artifacts.
- Where to document: `scrum.pmo/roles/DevOps/process.md`, `scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md`, `README.md`.

## 6. QA “Elephant in the Room” Analysis
- Undiscussed-but-blocking: large feature merges deleting canonical assets (workflows/journals) without safeguards.
- Named obstacle: lack of CI/branch rules allowed risky deletions and link drift.
- Solutions provided: adopt protected-path policy, partial merge strategy, and link hygiene checks; enrich journals with branch links for recovery.
