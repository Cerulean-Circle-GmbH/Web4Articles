# Project State — 2025-08-10 10:30 UTC

Status: I recovered context from README.md, scanned sprints and QA logs, then updated recovery.md and scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md to make “Recover from README” the default recovery policy with backlinks at line 1.
Project status (ScrumMaster)
Role: ScrumMaster coordinating across sprints and ensuring policy compliance.
Branch: Local branch is behind remote by 2 commits (fast-forward available).
Sprint 1
Open: task-1-tssh-wrapper.md (tssh wrapper/backend).
Sprint 2
Delivered: core navigation, completion integration, footer/colors, docs column, prompt handling.
Open in plan: 1.5 (E2E tests), 1.6 (PO docs), 6 (Tab behaves like Right), 7 (prompt-line editing). Repo logs/tests indicate Task 7 is implemented and passing; planning needs sync to match reality.
Sprint 3
All tasks open (GitScrumProject tool and automation).
Sprint 4
Devcontainer planning; tasks open (not started).
Sprint 5
Architecture/spec tracks (1–3) complete; implementation/testing tracks (4–6) pending under src.v2 plan (IO abstraction, MVC wiring, entry routing, toggle, non-interactive validations).
Sprint 6
Versioned folder migration (v2/src, v2/test) planned; all tasks open.
QA/Testing
Non-interactive usage is required for automated runs; use tsranger test for scripted sequences 1. Last recorded full suite pass was on 2025-08-09; re-run recommended after fast-forward.
Changes made
recovery.md
Added backlink on line 1 and a “Default Recovery Policy — Recover from README” section establishing README as canonical entry.
Appended 2025-08-10 status entry with consolidated project state and next steps.
scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md
Added backlink on line 1.
Added a “Default Recovery Policy — Recover from README” section mirroring the procedure and checklist.
Suggested next actions
Fast-forward to remote: git pull --ff-only
Sync Sprint 2 planning checkboxes to mark Task 7 as delivered.
Proceed with Sprint 5 implementation in src.v2 and validate using non-interactive runs (e.g., tsranger test "<sequence>") 1.
Optionally run the existing suite via npm test after fast-forward to re-confirm green state.
Would you like me to commit these documentation edits and fast-forward the branch? I can run:
git add recovery.md scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md
git commit -m "docs(scrum): make 'Recover from README' the default recovery policy; add status entry; add backlinks"
git pull --ff-only
Updated docs: recovery.md (added default policy, new status entry, backlink), scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md (added backlink, default policy).
Current status highlights: Sprint 1 open, Sprint 2 mostly delivered with planning drift on Task 7, Sprints 3–4 open, Sprint 5 spec done/impl pending, Sprint 6 planned, branch behind by 2 commits.
