### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Environment Validation**: Vitest properly configured, dependencies installed, test infrastructure operational
- [x] **Test Execution**: Successfully ran test suite - identified 8 failures across multiple components
- [x] **Failure Analysis**: Systematic analysis reveals data validation issues and outdated test expectations
- [ ] **Decision 1: Failure Resolution Priority**
  - a) **Scenario Validation Priority** - Fix 289 scenario files missing IOR/unitIndex properties (critical data integrity)
  - b) **Build Chain Priority** - Address build and integration test failures first (foundational issues)
  - c) **Component Testing Priority** - Focus on TSRanger and component-specific test failures
  - d) **Systematic Approach** - Address all categories simultaneously with parallel work streams

- [ ] **Decision 2: Test Infrastructure Improvement Strategy**
  - a) **Immediate Fixes** - Patch failing tests to restore green build, then systematic improvement
  - b) **Comprehensive Refactor** - Rebuild test infrastructure with modern patterns and better coverage
  - c) **Incremental Enhancement** - Fix critical failures, then gradually improve test quality and coverage
  - d) **Data-Driven Approach** - Focus on scenario data integrity first, then expand to other test areas

- [ ] **Decision 3: Quality Assurance Process Enhancement**
  - a) **Automated Quality Gates** - Implement pre-commit hooks and CI/CD quality checks
  - b) **Manual Testing Protocols** - Establish systematic manual testing procedures for critical paths
  - c) **Cross-Version Testing** - Implement systematic cross-version validation as per Tester role requirements
  - d) **Comprehensive QA Strategy** - Combine automated testing, manual validation, and systematic quality processes

Testing infrastructure analysis reveals systematic quality issues requiring immediate attention:
- 58 test files identified across project with comprehensive Vitest setup
- 8 test failures indicating data validation and expectation mismatches
- 289 scenario files missing required IOR and unitIndex properties
- Build chain and integration tests failing with systematic patterns
- TSRanger component tests showing cross-version consistency issues
```

### **My Answer**
Transitioning successfully to Tester role with comprehensive testing infrastructure analysis completed. Systematic failure patterns identified requiring structured approach to quality restoration and enhancement.
**Learning Applied:** Following Tester role systematic investigation methodology - cross-version analysis and infrastructure-first approach prevents misdiagnosis of root causes.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish comprehensive testing strategy and systematically address current quality issues

**Scope:** Full project testing infrastructure including scenario validation, component testing, build chains, and integration tests

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. **Data Integrity Issues** - 289 scenario files missing critical properties (IOR, unitIndex)
2. **Build Chain Failures** - Integration and build process test failures
3. **Component Testing** - TSRanger and other component-specific test issues
4. **Test Infrastructure** - Vitest configuration and test execution environment
5. **Quality Processes** - Systematic testing protocols and quality gates

**Targets:**
- Restore test suite to passing state (currently 8 failed | 7 passed)
- Implement systematic testing protocols per Tester role requirements
- Establish quality gates for continuous integration
- Create comprehensive test coverage analysis

**Inputs:**
- Current test results: 8 failures across multiple categories
- 58 test files identified with varying quality levels
- Vitest configuration properly set up with 30s timeout
- Tester role process documentation with systematic investigation methodology

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All critical test failures resolved
- Scenario data integrity restored (IOR/unitIndex properties)
- Build chain tests passing consistently
- Quality assurance process documented and implemented
- Test coverage gaps identified and addressed

**Assumptions:**
- Scenario files require IOR and unitIndex properties for valid operation
- Build chain issues may indicate infrastructure problems
- Cross-version testing patterns may reveal systematic issues

**Constraints:**
- Must use Vitest (Jest is banned per tech stack requirements)
- Follow systematic investigation methodology per Tester role
- Maintain compatibility across multiple component versions

**Options:**
1. **Sequential Approach** - Address one failure category at a time
2. **Parallel Approach** - Work on multiple failure types simultaneously
3. **Priority-Based** - Focus on highest impact failures first
4. **Systematic Analysis** - Deep investigation before fixes

**Rationale:** Systematic approach following Tester role methodology ensures proper root cause identification and prevents misdiagnosis that could waste development effort on wrong issues.

**Risks/Mitigations:**
- Risk: Fixing symptoms instead of root causes → Mitigation: Follow systematic investigation protocol
- Risk: Breaking working functionality → Mitigation: Comprehensive test validation before changes
- Risk: Time investment in low-impact issues → Mitigation: Priority-based approach with impact assessment

## **🔧 DO** 

**Testing Infrastructure Analysis Completed:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Vitest properly configured with 30s timeout, ESM-native setup
2. **Test Execution**: Successfully ran `npm test` - identified systematic failures
3. **Test File Inventory**: 58 test files discovered across project structure
4. **Failure Pattern Analysis**: 8 failures across multiple categories identified

**Test Failure Categories Identified:**

### **1. Scenario Validation Failures (Critical)**
- **Impact**: 289 scenario files missing required properties
- **Root Cause**: Missing `IOR` and `unitIndex` properties in scenario JSON files
- **Pattern**: Systematic data integrity issue across entire scenario dataset
- **Example Path**: `/workspace/scenarios/index/0/0/f/0/d/00f0de87-a8c8-4d0e-9a7b-d4c8efee3bf9.scenario.json`

### **2. Build Chain Failures**
- **Impact**: Integration and build process validation failing
- **Components**: Build chain tests, CLI functionality tests
- **Pattern**: Infrastructure and integration test failures

### **3. Component Testing Issues**
- **Impact**: TSRanger and other component-specific failures
- **Scope**: Multiple component versions affected
- **Pattern**: Cross-version consistency issues requiring systematic analysis

### **4. Test Count Expectation Failures**
- **Impact**: Test expecting <100 scenario files, but found 289
- **Root Cause**: Outdated test expectations not matching current data volume
- **Fix Required**: Update test expectations or validate data consistency

**Current Actions in Progress:**
- Creating comprehensive testing strategy PDCA
- Documenting systematic failure patterns
- Preparing priority-based resolution approach
- Following Tester role systematic investigation methodology
