### **My Answer**
Initiated PDCA framework following startup decision framework. Created session infrastructure, established dev branch, installed git automation, and prepared standard 3-decision startup framework for work direction.

**Learning Applied:** Follow systematic startup procedure with PDCA documentation and present meaningful choices for work direction.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategy:** Implement complete background agent startup procedure following recovery/start-command.md guidelines

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Proper PDCA framework initialization
- Session infrastructure established
- Standard 3 decisions presented for work direction
- Git automation configured for auto-merge
- User equipped to direct session focus

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Validate PDCA documentation availability
2. Create timestamped dev branch for session work
3. Install git post-commit hook for automation
4. Create session directory and project status
5. Generate startup PDCA with standard decision framework
6. Present decisions for user direction

---

## **🔧 DO** 

**Actions Completed:**

1. **Branch Management:**
   - Switched from cursor/start-background-process-c4a3 to save/start
   - Created dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1027 branch for session work
   - Set up branch tracking with origin

2. **PDCA Framework Setup:**
   - Verified howto.PDCA.md exists locally
   - Read complete PDCA guidelines and decision framework
   - Understood 6-section mandatory format requirements

3. **Git Automation:**
   - Installed post-commit hook for auto-merge to release/dev
   - Configured hook to trigger only on save/start branch
   - Set proper executable permissions

4. **Session Infrastructure:**
   - Created scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-1027-session/ directory
   - Generated project.status.md file with timestamp
   - Prepared session documentation structure

5. **Decision Framework:**
   - Applied startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md
   - Created standard 3-decision structure for work direction
   - Focused on meaningful choices that affect session direction

**Technical Implementation:**
```bash
# Branch switching and setup
git checkout save/start
git checkout -b dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1027
git push -u origin dev/2025-09-26-UTC-1027

# Git automation installation
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

# Session structure
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-1027-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-26-UTC-1027-session/project.status.md
```
