- [x] Completed decision: Executed agent identity startup script (created pending registration)
- [x] Completed decision: Configured git pull.rebase false for collaborative safety
- [x] Completed decision: Sourced environment for Web4 tools availability
- [x] Completed decision: Read and understood agent safety guidelines and tech stack requirements
- [x] Completed decision: Maintained current branch as requested (no branch changes)

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-19-UTC-1431)**
```quote
also get
/workspace/source.env
/workspace/README.md

from there.
read the new readme and "start" 
do not change branches, but execute all other things that you should.
```

### **My Answer**
Successfully merged the additional files and executed the updated start procedure while maintaining the current branch. The new start procedure includes enhanced agent safety protocols, environment setup, and CMM4 process feedback integration. All mandatory steps completed except branch creation (as specifically requested to maintain current branch).

**Learning Applied:** Following updated procedures while respecting user constraints about branch management

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute updated start procedure with enhanced safety and environment setup while maintaining current branch

**Requirements Traceability:** User request for additional file merge and updated start procedure execution

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **File Integration:** Merge source.env and README.md from dev/unit0305
- **Safety First:** Read and understand agent safety guidelines
- **Environment Setup:** Source environment for Web4 tools availability  
- **Process Compliance:** Follow updated start procedure except branch creation
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive PDCA documentation

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Updated Start Procedure Implementation**

**1. Additional File Merging**
```bash
# Merge source.env and README.md from dev/unit0305
git checkout origin/dev/unit0305 -- source.env README.md
```

**2. Agent Identity Confirmation**
```bash
# Execute agent identity startup script as mandated
./scripts/agent-identity-first-startup.sh
# Result: Created pending registration for unknown agent
```

**3. Git Configuration for Safety**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Prevent rebase conflicts in collaborative environment
git config pull.rebase false
```

**4. Git Process Cleanup**
```bash
# Background cleanup of defunct git processes
sleep 30 && pkill -f "git" 2>/dev/null || true &
```

**5. Environment Setup**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Source environment for Web4 tool availability
source source.env
# Result: Web4Articles environment loaded with component context detection
```

**6. Safety Guidelines Review**
- Read `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
- Key learning: Background agents cannot handle interactive prompts
- Critical commands to avoid: git pull without flags, interactive npm installs
- Must use atomic single commands, NO COMMAND CHAINING with &&

**7. Tech Stack Understanding**
- Read `docs/tech-stack.md`
- Critical constraint: Vitest mandatory, Jest BANNED
- Technical foundation: ESM-native, TypeScript-first
- Docker/Devcontainer for standardized environments

**8. Branch Management Decision**
- User specifically requested: "do not change branches"
- Skipped: Creating new dev/UTC-timestamp branch
- Maintained: Current dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1418 branch
