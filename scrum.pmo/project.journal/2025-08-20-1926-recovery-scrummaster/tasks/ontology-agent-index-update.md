# Task: Update and Maintain index.md

**Assigned to:** OntologyAgent  
**Created by:** ScrumMaster  
**Date:** 2025-08-20 UTC 19:40  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Pending

## Objective
Review and update the workspace index.md file to ensure it accurately reflects current project structure after cleanup operations.

## Context
During cleanup, we kept index.md but removed index.md.backup. The index.md file (119KB) may need updates to reflect:
- Removed files from cleanup (13 files deleted)
- New journal structure
- Updated PDCA locations
- Current project state

## Deliverables
- [ ] Analyze current index.md structure
- [ ] Remove references to deleted files:
  - qa-feedback-log.md
  - All merge reports and logs
  - emergency-ontology-agent-recovery-guide.md
  - handover.backend.agent.md
  - CONTEXT_PRESERVATION.md
  - COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md
  - test.matrix.md
  - tree.index.md
  - sprint-task-conflicts.txt
- [ ] Add new journal entries and PDCAs
- [ ] Ensure all links are functional
- [ ] Create PDCA documenting changes

## Notes
- Coordinate with ScrumMaster after completion
- Follow OntologyAgent process for index maintenance
- Reference cleanup PDCA: 2025-08-20-UTC-1940-cleanup-execution-report.md
