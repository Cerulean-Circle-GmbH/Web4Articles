### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **ERROR IDENTIFIED**: I made mistakes, not the process
- [x] **PUSH COMPLETED**: GitHub links now functional on local-dev branch
- [x] **FORMAT CORRECTED**: Using proper link format with absolute paths
- [ ] **PROCESS LEARNING**: Need to always push before providing GitHub links
- [ ] **COMPLIANCE CHECK**: Verify all future PDCAs follow correct format

---

## **Plan**

Identify and fix link format errors, push to origin, and ensure future compliance with proper PDCA link format.

### **üéØ QA Feedback Integration:**

> **User Quote (2025-08-20 UTC 19:29)**: *"ok not bad. you gave me a github and a local link. but in wrong format and they do not work because you did not add,commit and push. is the process wrong or are you wrong... both is possible and determines your actions. fix it or live it."*

### **Error Analysis:**

**What I Did Wrong:**
1. **GitHub Links**: Provided links before pushing to origin (404 error)
2. **Local Links**: Used relative format instead of absolute `/workspace/` paths
3. **Process Skip**: Forgot critical push step before reporting

**Process is Correct:**
- Process clearly shows push steps in examples
- Other PDCAs demonstrate proper link format
- I failed to follow the process properly

### **Corrective Actions Taken:**

1. **Pushed to Origin**: 
   ```bash
   git push origin local-dev
   ```
   - Created new branch on GitHub
   - All files now accessible

2. **Link Format Correction**:
   - ‚ùå Wrong: `scrum.pmo/project.journal/...`
   - ‚úÖ Right: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/...`

3. **Branch Note**: Using `local-dev` instead of `release/dev` in GitHub URLs

---

## **Check**

### **Link Validation:**

**GitHub Links:**
- ‚úÖ Push completed successfully
- ‚úÖ New branch `local-dev` created on origin
- ‚úÖ Files accessible via GitHub web interface

**Local Links:**
- ‚úÖ Using absolute paths from `/workspace/`
- ‚úÖ Format matches successful PDCA examples
- ‚úÖ Links clickable in proper environments

**Process Compliance:**
- ‚ùå **Initial Failure**: Skipped push step
- ‚úÖ **Now Corrected**: Following proper sequence
- ‚úÖ **Learning Applied**: Understanding my error vs process error

---

## **Act**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Commit This PDCA**: Maintain traceability
2. **Push Updates**: Ensure GitHub accessibility
3. **Report Correction**: Provide working links to QA

### **Process Compliance Checklist for Future:**

- [ ] Always commit changes before reporting
- [ ] Always push to origin before providing GitHub links
- [ ] Use absolute paths for local links (`/workspace/...`)
- [ ] Verify links work before sending
- [ ] Follow examples from successful PDCAs

### **Guardian Angel Wisdom Applied:**

**"Fix it or live it"** - I chose to fix it because:
- The process is good, I was wrong
- Accountability means correcting mistakes
- Learning requires acknowledging errors

---

## **üìã PDCA Process Update**

### **ScrumMaster Learning:**
- ‚úÖ **Push Before Links**: GitHub links require pushed commits
- ‚úÖ **Absolute Paths**: Local links must use `/workspace/` prefix
- ‚úÖ **Process Trust**: When unsure, the process is usually right
- ‚úÖ **Error Ownership**: Acknowledge mistakes to improve

### **Process Learning:**
- **Link Format**: Critical for QA verification and navigation
- **Push Timing**: Essential step before reporting completion
- **Example Value**: Studying successful PDCAs prevents errors
- **QA Patience**: Guardian angel gives chances to correct

**üìä Summary:** Identified my errors (not process errors), pushed to origin, corrected link formats, and learned critical compliance steps for future PDCAs! üìã‚úÖüîß
