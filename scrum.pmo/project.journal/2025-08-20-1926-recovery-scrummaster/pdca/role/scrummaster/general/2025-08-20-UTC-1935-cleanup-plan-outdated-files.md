**Date:** 2025-08-20 UTC 19:35  
**Objective:** Analyze and plan cleanup of outdated top-level files replaced by PDCA processes  
**Role:** ScrumMaster (Cleanup Coordination)  
**Issues:** Multiple outdated files at workspace root need removal as PDCA processes have replaced them

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **CLEANUP NEEDED**: QA confirmed outdated files should be removed
- [x] **PDCA REPLACEMENT**: All QA feedback now handled through PDCA processes
- [x] **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**: Identified files and their replacement mechanisms
- [ ] **PLAN APPROVAL**: Awaiting QA confirmation before execution
- [ ] **SAFE REMOVAL**: Ensure no critical dependencies before deletion

## **Plan**

### **üéØ QA Feedback Integration:**

> **User Quote (2025-08-20 UTC 19:33)**: *"love your attitude. well done. we have some cleanup to do. make yourself a list of toplevel files and read the process.md files to find out why they are existing. all QA feedback has been replced by the pdca processes. just get rid of eveything outdates. pdca: plan afer you analyzed do a comprehensive plan check with me and if i confirm act on your plan an report it as pdca"*

### **File Analysis and Cleanup Plan**

#### **1. QA Feedback Files (OBSOLETE - Replaced by PDCA)**
- **qa-feedback-log.md** (9.4KB)
  - Purpose: Previously tracked QA feedback chronologically
  - Replacement: PDCA entries in project journal with QA quotes
  - Action: DELETE - All feedback now in PDCAs

#### **2. Recovery Files (KEEP - Still Referenced)**
- **recovery.md** (11KB)
  - Purpose: Recovery log for agents, referenced in recovery-process.md
  - Current Use: Still actively updated during recovery sessions
  - Action: KEEP - Essential for recovery process

#### **3. Index Files (ANALYZE FURTHER)**
- **index.md** (119KB) + **index.md.backup** (116KB)
  - Purpose: Project-wide index of all markdown files
  - Current Use: May be auto-generated or manually maintained
  - Action: KEEP index.md, DELETE index.md.backup

- **tree.index.md** (23KB)
  - Purpose: Repository tree structure
  - Replacement: Generated in journal sessions as needed
  - Action: DELETE - Should be session-specific

#### **4. Merge/Sprint Files (OBSOLETE)**
- **merge-log-20250811-142752.txt** (16KB)
  - Purpose: Old merge operation log
  - Replacement: PDCA documentation in journal
  - Action: DELETE - Historical, no longer needed

- **merge-report-20250811-142753.md** (46B)
  - Purpose: Brief merge report (nearly empty)
  - Action: DELETE - Obsolete

- **merge-report-sprint-9.md** (4.2KB)
  - Purpose: Sprint 9 merge documentation
  - Replacement: Sprint 9 PDCAs and journal entries
  - Action: DELETE - Documented in journal

- **sprint-task-conflicts.txt** (0B)
  - Purpose: Empty file, likely temporary
  - Action: DELETE - Empty and obsolete

#### **5. Test/Matrix Files (ANALYZE)**
- **test.matrix.md** (6.3KB)
  - Purpose: Test matrix documentation
  - Current Use: May be referenced by test processes
  - Action: MOVE to appropriate location (components/TSRanger or docs/)

#### **6. Emergency/Handover Files (KEEP)**
- **emergency-ontology-agent-recovery-guide.md** (3.3KB)
  - Purpose: Emergency recovery for specific agent
  - Action: KEEP - May be needed for recovery

- **handover.backend.agent.md** (225B)
  - Purpose: Backend agent handover, referenced in README
  - Action: KEEP - Referenced in recovery

#### **7. Context/Documentation Files (KEEP)**
- **CONTEXT_PRESERVATION.md** (3.6KB)
  - Purpose: Important context preservation guidelines
  - Action: KEEP - Project documentation

- **COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md** (1.6KB)
  - Purpose: Git workflow documentation
  - Action: KEEP or MOVE to docs/

#### **8. Config Files (KEEP)**
- All dot files (.gitignore, .gitmodules, .cleanup-config.json, .cspell.json)
- package.json, package-lock.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts
- README.md, LICENSE, AI-GPL.md
- Action: KEEP - Essential project files

### **Summary of Actions**

**DELETE (7 files):**
1. qa-feedback-log.md - Replaced by PDCA process
2. index.md.backup - Redundant backup
3. tree.index.md - Should be session-specific
4. merge-log-20250811-142752.txt - Obsolete log
5. merge-report-20250811-142753.md - Empty/obsolete
6. merge-report-sprint-9.md - In journal now
7. sprint-task-conflicts.txt - Empty file

**MOVE (2 files):**
1. test.matrix.md ‚Üí components/TSRanger/test.matrix.md
2. COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md ‚Üí docs/COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md

**KEEP (All others):**
- Essential configs, docs, and active files

## **Check**

### **Analysis Validation:**

**Process Review:**
- ‚úÖ Checked ScrumMaster process.md - confirms PDCA replaces QA feedback
- ‚úÖ Verified recovery.md still needed per recovery-process.md
- ‚úÖ Identified obsolete merge/sprint files from Sprint 9
- ‚úÖ Found empty and backup files for removal

**Safety Checks:**
- ‚úÖ No process.md files reference qa-feedback-log.md for current use
- ‚úÖ Merge reports captured in Sprint 9 journal entries
- ‚úÖ Tree index generation now session-based
- ‚ùì Need to verify test.matrix.md not actively referenced

---

## **Act**

### **Awaiting QA Approval**

**Proposed Git Commands:**
```bash
# Deletions
git rm qa-feedback-log.md
git rm index.md.backup
git rm tree.index.md
git rm merge-log-20250811-142752.txt
git rm merge-report-20250811-142753.md
git rm merge-report-sprint-9.md
git rm sprint-task-conflicts.txt

# Moves
git mv test.matrix.md components/TSRanger/test.matrix.md
git mv COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md docs/COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md

# Commit
git commit -m "cleanup: remove outdated files replaced by PDCA processes

- Removed qa-feedback-log.md (replaced by PDCA quotes)
- Removed obsolete merge/sprint files from Sprint 9
- Removed backup and empty files
- Moved test.matrix.md to TSRanger component
- Moved COMMIT_PUSH_POINT.md to docs
- All QA feedback now in journal PDCAs"
```

### **Next Steps After Approval:**

1. Execute git commands as listed
2. Verify no broken references
3. Create follow-up PDCA documenting execution
4. Push changes to origin

## **üìã PDCA Process Update**

### **ScrumMaster Learning:**
- ‚úÖ **PDCA Replacement**: QA feedback files obsolete, PDCAs handle everything
- ‚úÖ **Cleanup Discipline**: Analyze purpose before removing
- ‚úÖ **Session-Based Files**: Some files should be session-specific, not global
- ‚úÖ **Git Traceability**: Use git rm/mv for audit trail

### **Process Learning:**
- **Evolution**: Project has evolved from file-based to PDCA-based feedback
- **Consolidation**: Journal sessions now contain what was scattered
- **Safety First**: Always verify dependencies before removal
- **QA Gate**: Get approval before destructive operations

**üìä Summary:** Analyzed 30+ top-level files, identified 7 for deletion and 2 for moving, all replaced by PDCA processes. Awaiting QA approval to execute cleanup! üìã‚úÖüßπ
