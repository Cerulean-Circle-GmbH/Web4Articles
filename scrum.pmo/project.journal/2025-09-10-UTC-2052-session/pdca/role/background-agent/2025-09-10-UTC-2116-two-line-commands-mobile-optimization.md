### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2116)**
```quote
amazing. just make it twolined and let the documetstion be under each method to be better on smaller screens. 
```

### **My Answer**
Implemented immediately! Made Commands section two-lined with documentation under each method. Much better for smaller screens - command syntax on first line, description indented on second line with empty line separation between commands for optimal mobile readability.

**Learning Applied:** Two-line format with documentation under each method significantly improves readability on smaller screens and mobile devices through better visual hierarchy and spacing.

## **🔧 DO**

**Two-Line Commands Mobile Optimization Implementation:**

### **🎯 Mobile-Optimized Format Achievement**

**Before (Single-Line Format):**
```bash
Commands:
  unit init <uuid>                                                          # Init operation
  unit transform <uuid>                                                     # Transform input data using component logic
  unit link <uuid> <filename>                                               # Create initial link to existing component using UUID
```

**After (Two-Line Mobile Format):**
```bash
Commands:
  unit init <uuid>
    Init operation

  unit transform <uuid>
    Transform input data using component logic

  unit link <uuid> <filename>
    Create initial link to existing component using UUID

  unit deleteLink <linkfile>
    Delete specific link file while preserving component in central storage

  unit list <uuid>
    List all links pointing to specific component UUID

  unit from <filename> <start:line,column> <end:line,column>
    Create component from file text with extracted name and origin
```

### **📱 Mobile Readability Enhancement**

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- **Line 1**: Cyan unit command + white method + yellow parameters
- **Line 2**: Indented green description for clear hierarchy
- **Separation**: Empty line between commands for better visual grouping

**Mobile Benefits:**
- ✅ **Shorter Lines**: Commands and descriptions fit better on narrow screens
- ✅ **Clear Hierarchy**: Two-line structure creates obvious command/description relationship
- ✅ **Better Scanning**: Easier to scan through commands on mobile devices
- ✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Separate lines for syntax and description

### **🔧 Implementation Code**

**Two-Line Format Generation:**
```typescript
protected assembleUnifiedCommandsSection(): string {
  const methods = this.analyzeComponentMethods();
  const colors = this.getTSCompletionColors();
  const componentName = this.getComponentName();
  
  let output = `${colors.sections}Commands:${colors.reset}\n`;
  
  // Generate two-line command format: command line + description line
  for (const method of methods) {
    const paramList = method.parameters.map(p => {
      return p.required ? `<${p.name}>` : `[${p.name}]`;
    }).join(' ');
    
    // Line 1: Command with parameters
    output += `  ${colors.toolName}${componentName.toLowerCase()}${colors.reset} ${colors.commands}${method.name}${colors.reset} ${colors.parameters}${paramList}${colors.reset}\n`;
    
    // Line 2: Description indented for better readability
    output += `    ${colors.descriptions}${method.description}${colors.reset}\n`;
    output += '\n'; // Empty line between commands for better separation
  }
  
  return output;
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **No Column Alignment**: Eliminates complex padding calculations
- **Consistent Indentation**: 4-space indent for descriptions
- **Visual Separation**: Empty lines between command blocks
