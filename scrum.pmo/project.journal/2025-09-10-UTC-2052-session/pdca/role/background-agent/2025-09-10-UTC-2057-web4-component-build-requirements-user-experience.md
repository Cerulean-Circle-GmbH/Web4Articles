### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Web4 Build Principle Located**: "When the component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken"
- [x] **Tech Stack Requirements**: Vitest mandatory, Jest banned, ESM modules, TypeScript-first
- [x] **Web4 10 Paradigm Shifts**: Empty constructors, scenario-first, IOR architecture, semantic invariants, etc.
- [x] **User Experience Gap**: Unit tool currently fails due to version management issues despite working implementation existing
- [ ] **Decision 1: Web4 Self-Building Component Enforcement**
  - a) **Strict Enforcement** - All components must build themselves or be marked as broken
  - b) **Build Validation** - Add build verification to all component startup scripts
  - c) **Progressive Migration** - Gradually fix non-self-building components
- [ ] **Decision 2: User Experience Improvement Priority**
  - a) **Immediate CLI Access** - Fix unit tool accessibility as highest priority
  - b) **Documentation First** - Document current UX gaps before fixing
  - c) **Systematic UX Audit** - Comprehensive user experience analysis across all tools

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2057)**
```quote
read the tech stack and the web4 requirements in sprint 20 at first. find what i said about components that do not build in web4

explain the user experience of using tools like unit

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Found your critical Web4 principle: "When the component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken!" Components must be self-building. Current user experience with unit tool is broken - users get "Unit CLI not found" despite working implementation existing in Unit 0.3.0.5. This violates Web4 self-building requirements.

**Learning Applied:** Web4 components must build themselves automatically - manual intervention indicates broken implementation per Web4 definition, creating poor user experience.

## **🔧 DO**

**Web4 Component Build Requirements and User Experience Analysis:**

### **🚨 Critical Web4 Principle Found**

**Your Exact Statement:**
```quote
"when the component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken!"
```

**Context:** From task-24-build-progressive-dependency-resolution.md and build-system-automation-violation PDCA

**Web4 Self-Building Component Requirements:**
- **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: Components must resolve their own dependencies
- **Self-Building Capability**: No manual npm install/build intervention required
- **Startup Validation**: Components verify they can build before showing usage
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: Any manual steps indicate broken Web4 implementation

### **📋 Tech Stack Requirements (STRICTLY ENFORCED)**

**Testing Framework:**
- ✅ **Vitest MANDATORY**: Modern ESM-native TypeScript-first test runner
- ❌ **Jest BANNED**: Poor ESM support, legacy CJS patterns, marked as evil
- ✅ **ESM Imports**: All tests use `import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'`

**Development Environment:**
- ✅ **TypeScript-first**: Modern JS features, top-level await, import.meta.url
- ✅ **Docker/DevContainer**: Standardized environments
- ✅ **GitHub CLI**: Repository automation tasks
- ✅ **PlantUML + Graphviz**: Architecture diagram rendering

### **🌐 Web4 Requirements (10 Paradigm Shifts)**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Empty Constructor Principle** - NO initialization parameters
2. **Scenario-First Development** - Objects hibernatable as JSON scenarios
3. **IOR Architecture** - References via IORs, not memory pointers
4. **Semantic Invariants** - All formats (CSV/JSON/XML/DB) semantically equivalent
5. **MDA Sphere Architecture** - Bounded sphere, not flat layers
6. **Git-based Business Processes** - Transaction chains with rollback
7. **ONCE Kernel Foundation** - Universal communication engine
8. **6-Hop Traceability** - Prose→Requirements→Tests→Features→Components→Versions→Units
9. **Radical OOP** - NO functions outside classes
10. **42 Architectural Answer** - TLA = MDAv4 + EAMv4 + SOAv4 based on Web4

### **😤 Current User Experience of Tools Like Unit (BROKEN)**

**User Journey - Current State:**
```bash
# User tries to use unit tool
$ unit create "MyUnit" "Description" "CLASS"

❌ Unit CLI not found in any expected location
🔍 Searched locations:
   - /workspace/components/Unit/0.1.3.0/dist/ts/layer5/UnitCLI.js
   - /workspace/components/Unit/latest/dist/ts/layer5/UnitCLI.js
   - /workspace/components/Unit/0.1.3.0/dist/ts/UnitCLI.js

🔧 To fix this, from project root (/workspace):
   1. cd components/Unit/0.1.3.0
   2. npm install
   3. npm run build
```

**User Experience Problems:**
1. **Tool Fails Immediately**: No helpful functionality, just error messages
2. **Manual Intervention Required**: User must manually build components
3. **Version Confusion**: Latest symlink points to non-functional version
4. **No Self-Recovery**: Tool doesn't attempt to fix itself
5. **Poor Error Messages**: Technical paths instead of user-friendly guidance

**Web4 Compliance Violation:**
- **Manual Steps Required**: Violates "component must do it itself" principle
- **Not Self-Building**: Tool fails instead of automatically resolving dependencies
- **Broken Per Definition**: Requires manual intervention = broken Web4 component

### **✅ Working User Experience (Unit 0.3.0.5)**

**What SHOULD Happen:**
```bash
# User tries to use unit tool (if properly configured)
$ unit

unit CLI Tool v0.3.0.5 - Dynamic Method Discovery

Usage:
  unit help                    # Show this help
  unit info                    # Show component info

Commands automatically discovered from component methods
Add new methods to component and they become available immediately

Web4 Integration:
  Unit operates as atomic Web4 element with terminal identification (uni-t).
  All units use central UUID storage with enhanced references array.
  Internal CLI architecture with DefaultCLI base class and dynamic method discovery.
```

**Optimal User Experience Features:**
- ✅ **Immediate Functionality**: Tool works without setup
- ✅ **Self-Building**: Automatically handles dependencies
- ✅ **Dynamic Discovery**: New methods appear automatically
- ✅ **Clear Output**: Version identification and capability description
- ✅ **TSCompletion Integration**: Color coding and completion support

### **🔧 Web4 Component Build Pattern**

**Self-Building Component Requirements:**
```bash
# Component startup sequence (Web4 compliant)
1. Check if built (dist/ exists and newer than src/)
2. If not built: npm install && npm run build (automatic)
3. If build fails: Show helpful error with resolution steps
4. If build succeeds: Show functionality immediately
5. Never require manual intervention
```

**Current Reality (BROKEN):**
```bash
# Current broken pattern
1. Check if built
2. If not built: Show error and manual steps
3. User must manually: cd component && npm install && npm run build
4. User must manually: return to workspace root
5. Try tool again (may still fail due to version issues)
```

### **📊 User Experience Analysis**

**Current UX Problems:**
- **Immediate Failure**: Tools fail on first use without helpful recovery
- **Manual Complexity**: Users need deep technical knowledge to fix tools
- **Version Management**: Users confused by multiple versions and symlinks
- **No Self-Help**: Tools don't attempt automatic problem resolution
- **Technical Exposure**: Users see internal paths and build errors

**Web4 UX Requirements:**
- **Zero Setup**: Tools work immediately without configuration
- **Self-Healing**: Components fix their own build/dependency issues
- **Clear Communication**: User-friendly messages, not technical error dumps
- **Version Transparency**: Users don't need to understand internal versioning
- **Functionality Focus**: Users interact with capabilities, not implementation details
