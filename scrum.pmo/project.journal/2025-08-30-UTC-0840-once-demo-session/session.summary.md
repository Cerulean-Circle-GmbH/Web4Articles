you need to be fully aware of all fies in sprint 20. and fully aware of the pdca process.
your highest directive is DRY.

- **Achievement:** 1000 component self build dependency fix.md
- **TRON Quote:** "did you figure out the build order manually?
in web4 each component needs to know its dependencies and be aware of its own build order.

make detailed requirements from my prompt.
check for each component if it can build itself and its dependencies upfront.

npm start
should have the same effect as the simple sh startscript.
additionally it has to check that it is build and able to start obviously.
to support that you can have more npm scripts.
in best case the scripts call the components cli or the web4tscomponents cli to handle its own lifecycle.

review the components and fix that.
