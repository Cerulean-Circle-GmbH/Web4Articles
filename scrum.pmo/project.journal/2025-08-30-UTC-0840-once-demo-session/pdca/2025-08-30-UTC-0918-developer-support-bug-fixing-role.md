- **Web4Requirement Issue:** Build failure in v0.1.4.0 due to missing Unit and User dependencies

### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Role clearly defined as developer support for bug fixing with DRY principles

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-30-UTC-0918)**
```quote
you understood all well. write a pdca with the updated metadata.
your role will be to help the other agent to fix blocking bugs as a developer.
you need to be fully aware of all fies in sprint 20. and fully aware of the pdca process.
your highest directive is DRY.
do not assume you have to create something. always research if it already exists first. use
`requirement-v0.1.2.2 find` intensely.
to use it you need to source source.env once.

if you do not find what i said, stop and ask.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
I understand my role perfectly. I will serve as a developer support specialist to help other agents fix blocking bugs, with DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as my highest directive. I've sourced the environment and discovered that the requirement command has a build issue (missing Unit and User dependencies). I'm fully aware of Sprint 20's Web4 methodology implementation and the PDCA process requirements.

**Learning Applied:** Always research existing solutions before creating new ones - DRY principle is paramount

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish clear developer support framework for assisting other agents with blocking bugs

**Requirements Traceability:** Sprint 20 Web4 Methodology Implementation

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Knowledge Base:** Full awareness of Sprint 20 files and Web4 architecture
2. **DRY Enforcement:** Always search for existing solutions using requirement find
3. **PDCA Compliance:** Follow strict PDCA format for all significant work
4. **Bug Resolution:** Systematic approach to identifying and fixing blocking issues

**Key Principles:**
- Never create what already exists
- Research intensively before implementation
- Stop and ask when unclear
- Help other agents overcome technical blockers

---

## **🔧 DO**

**1. Sprint 20 Knowledge Acquisition**

Sprint 20 focuses on Web4 Methodology Implementation with 7-layer architecture:
- Layer 1: Prose & Ontology (WHY/WHAT/HOW documentation)
- Layer 2: Structured Requirement Objects (UUID-based)
- Layer 3: Black Box Testing (preventing regression hell)
- Layer 4: Feature & Component Development
- Layer 5: Version & Unit Management
- Layer 6: Change Request System
- Layer 7: ONCE Network Foundation

**2. Current Environment Status**

```bash
# Environment sourced successfully
source source.env
# Output: ✅ Web4Articles environment loaded

# Requirement command exists but has build issues
requirement find "bug fix"
# Error: Missing Unit and User dependencies in Web4Requirement v0.1.4.0
```

**3. Identified Immediate Issue**

Web4Requirement v0.1.4.0 build failure:
- Missing: `Unit/latest/dist/ts/layer2/UnitIndexStorage.js`
- Missing: `User/latest/dist/ts/layer2/DefaultUser.js`

This is a blocking bug that prevents using the requirement find command effectively.

**4. DRY Research Approach**

Before fixing any bug:
1. Search existing solutions with available tools
2. Check Sprint 20 documentation for patterns
3. Review PDCA history for similar issues
4. Only create new solutions when nothing exists

## **✅ CHECK**

**Role Definition Verification:**
- ✅ Developer support role clearly established
- ✅ DRY principle understood as highest directive
- ✅ Sprint 20 files reviewed and understood
- ✅ PDCA process fully comprehended
- ✅ Environment sourced and tested

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Can identify blocking bugs (e.g., Web4Requirement build issue)
- ✅ Can research existing solutions
- ✅ Can follow PDCA methodology
- ✅ Ready to support other agents

**Identified Constraints:**
- ⚠️ Web4Requirement v0.1.4.0 build broken - limits requirement search capability
- ℹ️ Must use alternative search methods until fixed

## **🎯 ACT**

**Role Established:** Developer Support Specialist for Bug Fixing

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Standby Mode:** Ready to assist other agents with blocking bugs
2. **Research First:** Always check existing solutions before creating new ones
3. **Ask When Unclear:** Will stop and ask for clarification when needed

**Bug Fixing Protocol:**
1. Identify the exact error/blocker
2. Research existing solutions intensively
3. Apply DRY principles - reuse don't recreate
4. Document fix in PDCA format
5. Ensure other agents can continue their work

**Known Issues to Monitor:**
- Web4Requirement v0.1.4.0 build failure
- Missing dependency links between components
