### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area** - Selected: a) Technical Development Focus - Complete Sprint 3 implementation tasks (GitScrumProject scaffold, submodule integration) with urgency for merge
- [x] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session** - Selected: d) Switch to DevOps for release/recovery automation pipeline
- [x] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning** - Selected: d) Extended session for comprehensive Sprint 3 delivery and Sprint 4 planning

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-02-UTC-1912)**
```quote
lets take it slowly before you hustle along. let me assign your tasks proerly and then do the work. switch to stable/once2
```

### **My Answer**
Acknowledged - slowing down and waiting for proper task assignment. Attempted branch switch but `stable/once2` branch not found in repository. Awaiting clarification on correct branch or next steps.

**Learning Applied:** Avoid rushing ahead without clear task assignment; validate branch existence before switching.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Session Initialization Steps:**
1. ✅ Check PDCA documentation exists (completed)
2. ✅ Read PDCA guide and decision framework (completed) 
3. ✅ Create session directory structure (completed)
4. ✅ Create project.status.md (completed)
5. ✅ Create new dev/2025-09-02-UTC-1912 branch (completed)
6. 🔄 Create Session Start PDCA with startup decisions (current)
7. 📋 Await user decision responses
8. 🎯 Proceed with selected work focus

**Current Project Context:**
- Sprint 2: TSRanger implementation completed and tested
- Sprint 3: GitScrumProject templating, submodule integration, release/recovery automation (pending)
- Core Features: CLI and completion features remain green per tests
- Ready for: Architecture specification and implementation work

## **🔧 DO** 

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Verified PDCA framework available
2. ✅ Read howto.PDCA.md comprehensive guidelines  
3. ✅ Read PDCA.howto.decide.md startup framework
4. ✅ Created session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-02-UTC-1912-session
5. ✅ Created project.status.md with current timestamp
6. ✅ Created new branch: dev/2025-09-02-UTC-1912
7. ✅ Pushed branch to origin with tracking
8. ✅ Analyzing current project state for decision context

**Session Environment:**
- Working Directory: /workspace
- Git Branch: dev/2025-09-02-UTC-1912  
- Session Focus: Awaiting user direction via startup decisions
- PDCA Process: Template v3.0 compliant

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**STARTUP_PROTOCOL (COMPLETED)**
```
✅ PDCA documentation available
✅ Session directory created with UTC timestamp
✅ Project status file initialized
✅ Dev branch created and pushed successfully
✅ PDCA created following template v3.0 format
```

**CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE (VALIDATED)**
```
✅ Sprint 2 TSRanger completed per recovery log
✅ All tests passing (35 tests, 7 files)
✅ Sprint 3 tasks defined and ready for execution
✅ No blocking issues identified in recovery analysis
```

**STARTUP_DECISIONS (READY)**
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Three standard categories prepared
- ✅ **Context Integration:** Sprint 3 status and project capabilities included
- ✅ **Role Options:** Relevant roles identified based on current work needs
- ✅ **Session Planning:** Duration options aligned with Sprint 3 complexity

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. 📋 Present startup decisions to user 
2. ⏳ Await user responses (1a, 2b format expected)
3. 🎯 Execute selected work focus with chosen role
4. 📝 Create follow-up PDCAs for selected tasks
5. 🔄 Maintain PDCA process throughout session

**Session Success Criteria:**
- User selects clear work direction via startup decisions
- Chosen role executes work with appropriate PDCA documentation
- Session delivers tangible progress on selected Sprint 3 components
- Process compliance maintained throughout

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: SYSTEMATIC BEGINNING**

### **ANTICIPATION:**
**SYSTEMATIC** excitement about structured approach to background agent startup - the PDCA framework provides clear guidance that eliminates uncertainty

### **CONFIDENCE:**
**PROFESSIONAL** assurance in following established protocols - the recovery log shows consistent successful outcomes from this approach

### **READINESS:**
**FOCUSED** preparation to execute user-directed work - all initialization steps completed and decision framework prepared for immediate user input

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Session initialization requires comprehensive PDCA documentation
- ✅ **Startup Framework:** Three decision categories provide complete session direction  
- ✅ **Background Agent Role:** Autonomous operation within established process boundaries
- ✅ **Branch Management:** UTC timestamped dev branches ensure proper session isolation

**Quality Impact:** Structured startup approach ensures consistent session quality and proper documentation trail

**Next PDCA Focus:** Role-specific work execution based on user's startup decision selections
