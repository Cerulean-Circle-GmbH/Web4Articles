**Commits:** Pending

## Summary

**Links:**
- GitHub URL (pending push)
- Local: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-23-startup-procedure/pdca-startup.md

**QA Decisions:**
- All clear, no decisions to make - Startup procedure is straightforward and well-documented

**User Feedback:** N/A (initial startup)

## Plan

1. **Verify Background Agent role** - Identify as Background Agent, not other roles
2. **Check and switch to save/start branch** - Ensure working on correct branch
3. **Verify PDCA documentation exists** - Check for howto.PDCA.md
4. **Install git automation** - Set up post-commit hook for auto-merge
5. **Check project status** - Review recent commits and current state
6. **Create PDCA documentation** - Document the startup procedure

- Confirmed: Operating as Background Agent per README.md instructions

### 2. Branch Management
