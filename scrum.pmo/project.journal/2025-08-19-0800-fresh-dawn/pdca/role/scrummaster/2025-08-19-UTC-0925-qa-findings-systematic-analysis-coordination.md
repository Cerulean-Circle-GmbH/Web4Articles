**Date:** 2025-08-19 UTC 09:25  
**Role:** ScrumMaster  
**Objective:** Coordinate systematic analysis of TRON's QA findings vs Matrix v4 and architectural improvements  
**Issues:** Critical filter+backspace bug discovered, prompt update inconsistencies, need role-based analysis coordination

## **üìä SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- [Matrix v4](../../../../sprints/sprint-5/test.matrix.v4.md) | [Matrix v4 Reference](../../../../sprints/sprint-5/test.matrix.v4.md)
- [Mount Everest Session](../../../project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev/) | [Session Directory](../../../project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev/)

### **TRON QA Feedback (2025-08-19 UTC 09:25)**
> **"we need to validate the v4 matrix from my basic QA testing today and let the tester deveop correct tests. later we consolidate the code as learned with DYR/OOP based on the tests."**

### **Critical QA Findings from TRON Manual Testing:**

#### **‚úÖ WORKING CORRECTLY:**
- **Navigation:** Up/down works as intended in all columns ‚úÖ
- **Column Transition:** Left/right column transition works as intended ‚úÖ  
- **Classes Column:** Prompt updated as intended in current version ‚úÖ
- **Navigation Chains:** Any number of up/down/left/right combinations work ‚úÖ
- **Basic Filtering:** Typing [t] or [g] works well ‚úÖ
- **Backspace:** Removes from filter correctly ‚úÖ

#### **‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED:**
- **Prompt Update Inconsistency:** "prompt line is not always updated as expected after each navigation" ‚ùå
- **CRITICAL BUG - Filter Corruption:** "typing [t][backspace][g] results wrongly in a 'tg' filter and prompt while 'g' would be naturally right" ‚ùå
- **State Corruption:** "afterwards the state is so broken that one has to exit tsranger" ‚ùå

#### **üîß ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **DRY/OOP:** "ShiftTab/Tab should work identically and use the same OOP methods" 
- **Encapsulation:** Need better column and row behavior encapsulation
- **3 Degrees of Freedom:** Apply revolutionary framework to architecture

---

## **üìù PLAN**

### **Multi-Role Analysis Strategy**
1. **Tester Role:** Validate QA findings vs Matrix v4, identify test gaps and ambiguities
2. **Architect Role:** Analyze encapsulation improvements, create PUML diagrams for current/future state
3. **ScrumMaster Role:** Coordinate findings and plan implementation approach

### **Critical Issue Priority**
**Priority 1:** Filter corruption bug ([t][backspace][g] ‚Üí "tg")  
**Priority 2:** Prompt update inconsistencies after navigation  
**Priority 3:** DRY/OOP compliance for ShiftTab/Tab  
**Priority 4:** Architectural encapsulation improvements  

### **Analysis Scope**
- **Matrix v4 Validation:** Compare TRON findings vs documented test expectations
- **Test Gap Analysis:** Identify missing test cases for discovered issues
- **Architectural Review:** Apply 3 Degrees of Freedom framework to current issues
- **DRY/OOP Assessment:** Ensure paired operations use identical methods
