## Project status (ScrumMaster)
- **Role**: ScrumMaster (recovery session), analyzing system failure and establishing recovery protocols
- **Branch**: [cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949)
- **Context**: Recovered from critical system failure caused by massive branch divergence merge attempt

## Critical Findings
- **Root Cause**: Resource exhaustion from attempting to merge test/recovery (339 commits ahead, 30 behind)
- **Failure Pattern**: Terminal hang → Read timeouts (160-220s) → Socket errors → Complete I/O failure
- **Key Learning**: Progressive degradation is predictable; act at first timeout signs
- **Recovery Strategy**: Route around problems with fresh branches, don't fix during crisis

## Environment
- Docker: Available (using updown-dev-container as preferred)
- Node: v18+ LTS required per package.json
- PlantUML/Graphviz: Available via devcontainer
- Devcontainer: Configured and ready for use

## Tests
- Current branch tests: Not run (recovery session)
- Action: Run full test suite after recovery to verify system stability

## Branching and CI/CD
- Primary branches: [main](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/main) (prod), [release/production](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/production) (mirror), [release/testing](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/testing), [release/dev](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev)
- Dangerous Branch: test/recovery (339/30 divergence - DO NOT MERGE)
- Status:
  - Clean working tree on safe recovery branch
  - System fully operational after recovery
  - Enhanced recovery protocols documented
- Recommendations:
  - Monitor branch divergence before any merge attempts
  - Delete or archive heavily diverged branches
  - Use fresh branches for all recovery operations

## Recovery Documentation
- **System Failure PDCA**: [Local](./pdca/role/scrummaster/general/2025-08-19-UTC-1100-system-failure-recovery-analysis.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/cursor/recovery-from-readme-20250819-0949/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-1100-recovery/pdca/role/scrummaster/general/2025-08-19-UTC-1100-system-failure-recovery-analysis.md)
- **Previous PDCAs Analyzed**:
  - Terminal Hang Recovery: [Local](../2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0949-terminal-hang-recovery-successful.md)
  - Tool Timeout Analysis: [Local](../2025-08-19-0825-sprint8-scrummaster/pdca/2025-08-19-UTC-0958-tool-timeout-analysis.md)

## Sprints Overview
- Active Sprints: Check [scrum.pmo/sprints/](../../sprints/) for current sprint status
- Recovery Focus: System stability and failure analysis takes precedence
- Next Sprint Planning: Resume after recovery validation

## Recent Activity
- Analyzed critical system failure from branch merge attempt
- Identified resource exhaustion as root cause
- Established enhanced recovery protocols
- Created comprehensive PDCA documentation
- Chat history exported to CeruleanCircle/AI.Agent.setup/chat_history.md

## Risks/Blockers
- **Branch Divergence**: test/recovery branch dangerously diverged (339/30)
- **Resource Limits**: Large operations can cause cascading failures
- **Verification Gap**: Success reporting without verification capability

## Next Steps
- Validate system stability with test suite
- Review and clean up diverged branches
- Implement branch divergence monitoring
- Continue development on safe branches only
- Apply lessons learned to prevent future failures

## Recovery Lessons
1. **Early Warning Signs**: Act on first timeout (>30s operations)
2. **Degradation Pattern**: Timeouts → Socket errors → Complete failure
3. **Response Protocol**: Document while writes work, exit gracefully
4. **Recovery Philosophy**: Fresh start better than fixing broken state
