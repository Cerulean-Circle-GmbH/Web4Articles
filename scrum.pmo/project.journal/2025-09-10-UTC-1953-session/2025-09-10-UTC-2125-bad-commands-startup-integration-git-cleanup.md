### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Critical safety enhancements must be integrated into startup process to prevent agent failures.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2125)**
```quote
add the mandatory read of this file to the start process. add the recovery to kill all git comments after 30 seconds after start.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Critical safety integration required! I'll add the bad interactive commands list as mandatory reading to the startup process and include git process cleanup after 30 seconds to prevent defunct process accumulation. This ensures all agents understand command safety before any operations.

**Learning Applied:** Agent safety requires proactive bad command awareness and system cleanup to prevent terminal hangs and process accumulation.

## **üìã PLAN**

**Startup Safety Enhancement Strategy:**

**BAD COMMANDS LIST INTEGRATION:**
- Add mandatory reading of `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
- Position after environment setup but before any git operations
- Ensure agents understand interactive command dangers before work begins
- Critical for background agent safety and reliability

**GIT PROCESS CLEANUP INTEGRATION:**
- Add 30-second delayed git process cleanup to startup
- Kill defunct git processes that accumulate from interactive command failures
- Prevent system resource drain from zombie processes
- Ensure clean environment for agent operations

**STARTUP SEQUENCE ENHANCEMENT:**
1. Git Configuration (pull.rebase false)
2. Golden Rule (CMM4 Process Feedback)
3. **Bad Commands Safety (NEW)** - Mandatory reading
4. **Git Cleanup (NEW)** - Kill defunct processes after 30s
5. Source Environment (tool availability)
6. Initialize PDCA Framework
7. Read PDCA Guide
8. Read Tech Stack
9. Create Session Start PDCA
10. Project Status & Branch Management

**SAFETY PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:**
- Proactive education about dangerous commands
- System cleanup to prevent resource issues
- Background agent protection through awareness
- Terminal reliability enhancement

## **üîß DO** 

**Startup Safety Enhancement Implementation:**

**README INTEGRATION STRATEGY:**

**New Step: Bad Commands Safety Reading**
```markdown
3. **Read Agent Safety Guidelines (MANDATORY)**:
   - Read: `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
   - Critical: Understand commands that cause terminal hangs
   - Background agents CANNOT handle interactive prompts
   - Must use non-interactive flags for all commands
```

**New Step: Git Process Cleanup**
```markdown
4. **Git Process Cleanup (SYSTEM MAINTENANCE)**:
   ```bash
   # Wait 30 seconds then kill defunct git processes
   sleep 30 && pkill -f "git" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   - Cleans up defunct git processes from previous interactive failures
   - Prevents system resource drain
   - Ensures clean environment for agent operations
   - Non-blocking operation for startup continuation
```

**STARTUP SEQUENCE REORGANIZATION:**
1. **Git Configuration** (pull.rebase false)
2. **Golden Rule** (CMM4 Process Feedback)
3. **Agent Safety Guidelines** (bad commands awareness)
4. **Git Process Cleanup** (defunct process cleanup)
5. **Source Environment** (Web4 tool availability)
6. **Initialize PDCA Framework**
7. **Read PDCA Guide**
8. **Read Tech Stack**
9. **Create Session Start PDCA**
10. **Project Status & Branch Management**

**SAFETY PROTOCOL ENHANCEMENT:**
- **Proactive Education**: Agents learn about dangerous commands before using them
- **System Cleanup**: Regular defunct process cleanup prevents accumulation
- **Background Agent Protection**: Explicit awareness of interactive prompt limitations
- **Terminal Reliability**: Preventive measures ensure consistent agent operation

**BAD COMMANDS LIST CONTENT VERIFICATION:**
‚úÖ **File Exists**: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
‚úÖ **Content Complete**: Dangerous commands, safe alternatives, recovery procedures
‚úÖ **Agent Safety Focus**: Specifically designed for background agent protection
‚úÖ **Incident Documentation**: Real examples from actual terminal hang incidents

**GIT CLEANUP COMMAND DESIGN:**
```bash
sleep 30 && pkill -f "git" 2>/dev/null || true
```
- **30-second delay**: Allows normal git operations to complete
- **pkill -f "git"**: Kills processes matching "git" pattern
- **2>/dev/null**: Suppresses error output if no processes found
- **|| true**: Ensures command doesn't fail if no git processes exist
- **Non-blocking**: Runs in background, doesn't stop startup flow
