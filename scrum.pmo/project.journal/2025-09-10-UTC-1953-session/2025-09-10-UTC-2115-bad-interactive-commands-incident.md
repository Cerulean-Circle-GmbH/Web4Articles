## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [§/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-10-UTC-1953-session/2025-09-10-UTC-2115-bad-interactive-commands-incident.md](./2025-09-10-UTC-2115-bad-interactive-commands-incident.md)
- **Bad Commands List:** [§/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md](../../../scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md)

### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - This is critical safety documentation to prevent future terminal hangs for background agents.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2115)**
```quote
are you stuck in an interactive command?
```

```quote
bad interactive command. start a list bad.interactive.sh.commands.md in sprint 20
```

### **My Answer**
Yes, the git pull command hung in an interactive state. I've created the bad interactive commands list in Sprint 20 to document this incident and prevent future terminal hangs for background agents. Terminal is now recovered and working.

**Learning Applied:** Background agents must avoid interactive commands that require user input, as they cause terminal hangs and process failures.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Interactive Command Incident Analysis:**

**INCIDENT DETAILS:**
- **Command**: `git pull origin dev/once0304 && git push origin dev/once0304`
- **Issue**: Git pull hung waiting for interactive merge resolution
- **Duration**: 900s timeout before failure
- **Impact**: Terminal session became unresponsive
- **Recovery**: Started fresh terminal session

**SAFETY DOCUMENTATION CREATED:**
- **File**: `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md`
- **Purpose**: Track commands that cause interactive hangs
- **Content**: Confirmed bad commands, safe alternatives, recovery procedures
- **Target**: Background agent safety and reliability

**PROCESS IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:**
1. **Git Safety Protocol**: Always use non-interactive flags
2. **Command Validation**: Check for interactive potential before execution
3. **Recovery Procedures**: Document terminal recovery methods
4. **Prevention Guidelines**: Safe alternatives for common operations

**DEFUNCT PROCESS ANALYSIS:**
- Multiple defunct git processes found (40+ processes)
- Pattern of interactive command failures
- Need for systematic cleanup and prevention

## **🔧 DO** 

**Interactive Command Safety Implementation:**

**BAD INTERACTIVE COMMANDS LIST CREATED:**
Successfully created `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md` with:

**Confirmed Bad Commands:**
- `git pull origin branch` - Hangs on merge conflicts
- `git cherry-pick` - Requires `--no-commit` flag
- `git merge` - Interactive conflict resolution
- `git rebase` - Interactive prompts
- `npm install` - Should use `--yes` flag
- `apt-get install` - Should use `-y` flag

**Safe Alternatives Documented:**
- `git pull --no-edit origin branch`
- `git cherry-pick --no-commit`
- `npm ci` or `npm install --yes`
- `apt-get install -y package`

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Background agents cannot send Ctrl+C
- Must start new terminal session when hung
- Previous work may be lost if not committed
- Prevention through non-interactive flags essential

**INCIDENT DOCUMENTATION:**
- **Incident 1**: 2025-09-10-UTC-2115 git pull hang
- **Cause**: Interactive merge/conflict resolution prompt
- **Impact**: 900s timeout, terminal unresponsive
- **Resolution**: Fresh terminal session
- **Prevention**: Use `git pull --no-edit` or `git config pull.rebase false`

**DEFUNCT PROCESS CLEANUP:**
- Identified 40+ defunct git processes
- Pattern indicates repeated interactive command failures
- System cleanup may be needed
- Prevention more important than cleanup

**SAFETY PROTOCOL ENHANCEMENT:**
- Always check commands for interactive potential
- Use non-interactive flags by default
- Document safe alternatives for common operations
- Create recovery procedures for stuck sessions
