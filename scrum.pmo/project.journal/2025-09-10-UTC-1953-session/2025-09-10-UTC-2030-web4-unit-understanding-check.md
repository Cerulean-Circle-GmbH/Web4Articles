### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - This is knowledge verification and understanding documentation before reality check validation.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2030)**
```quote
before i test it let me check if you understand it.
the components have to self build. there is only one precondition to use the tools. pdca what you know about it and how to create a unit and what it is. do not use the tools now, just explain your understanding of it. we use it in the next pdca to have a explanation vs reality check!

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Understood! You want me to document my current understanding of the Web4 unit system and component self-build mechanism without using tools, so we can then compare my understanding against reality. This will validate whether my Web4 analysis captured the essential concepts correctly before testing with a new agent.

**Learning Applied:** Understanding verification through explanation before reality check ensures accurate knowledge transfer and identifies gaps in architectural comprehension.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Web4 Unit Understanding Documentation Strategy:**

**My Current Understanding of Web4 Units:**
1. **Unit Definition**: Self-contained, hibernatable objects with UUID identification
2. **Self-Build Capability**: Components can build themselves without external dependencies
3. **Precondition**: One requirement to use the tools (need to identify what this is)
4. **Unit Creation Process**: Systematic approach to creating new units
5. **Architecture Integration**: How units fit into the broader Web4 ecosystem

**Key Questions to Address:**
- What exactly is a "unit" in Web4 context?
- How does the self-build mechanism work?
- What is the single precondition for tool usage?
- What is the unit creation process?
- How do units relate to components and scenarios?

**Understanding Validation Approach:**
- Document current comprehension without tool assistance
- Prepare for reality check comparison
- Identify potential knowledge gaps
- Enable accurate correction and learning

## **🔧 DO** 

**Web4 Unit Understanding Documentation:**

## **🔧 MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF WEB4 UNITS**

### **What is a Web4 Unit?**

**My Understanding:**
A Web4 Unit appears to be a self-contained, hibernatable object that represents a discrete piece of functionality or data within the Web4 ecosystem. Based on my analysis:

- **UUID-Based Identity**: Every unit has a unique identifier for reference and hibernation
- **Scenario Serializable**: Units can be converted to/from scenario representations  
- **Self-Contained**: Units don't depend on external configuration or environment variables
- **Web4 Pattern Compliant**: Empty constructors + init(scenario) initialization
- **Layered Architecture**: Units follow the layer2/layer3/layer5 structure

### **Component Self-Build Mechanism**

**My Understanding:**
Components have the ability to build themselves without external build systems or complex dependency management:

- **Internal Build Logic**: Components contain their own build and compilation logic
- **Progressive Dependencies**: Build system resolves dependencies incrementally  
- **No External Build Tools**: Don't require external webpack/rollup/etc.
- **Version Management**: Self-build respects component versioning (0.3.0.4 structure)
- **Layer Compilation**: Can build across layer2/layer3/layer5 independently

**Example I Observed:**
- ONCE component has its own build artifacts in `/dist/` directory
- Components have individual `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files
- Build component (0.3.0.4) seems to coordinate the self-build process

### **The Single Precondition**

**My Best Guess:**
Based on the Web4 patterns I've seen, the single precondition might be:

- **Scenario Availability**: Need a scenario to initialize the unit/component
- **UUID Generation**: Need to generate/assign a UUID for the unit
- **Empty Constructor**: Component must follow Web4 empty constructor pattern
- **IOR Reference**: Need an IOR (Internet Object Reference) for the unit

**Honestly:** I'm not certain what the single precondition is - this might be a gap in my understanding.

### **Unit Creation Process**

**My Understanding:**
Based on Web4 patterns, unit creation likely involves:

1. **UUID Generation**: Create unique identifier for the unit
2. **Class Definition**: Define unit class with empty constructor
3. **Interface Implementation**: Implement relevant Web4 interfaces  
4. **Scenario Support**: Add init(scenario) and toJSON() methods
5. **Layer Placement**: Place implementation in appropriate layer
6. **IOR Registration**: Create IOR reference for the unit
7. **Self-Build Integration**: Ensure unit can build itself

**Example Pattern I Inferred:**
```typescript
// My understanding of unit creation
class MyUnit implements UnitInterface {
  uuid: string = '';
  
  constructor() {} // Empty constructor
  
  init(scenario: any): this {
    this.uuid = scenario.uuid || generateUUID();
    // Initialize from scenario
    return this;
  }
  
  toJSON(): any {
    return { uuid: this.uuid, /* other state */ };
  }
}
```

### **Unit vs Component vs Scenario Relationship**

**My Understanding:**
- **Component**: The versioned directory structure (e.g., `/components/IOR/0.3.0.3/`)
- **Unit**: An instance of a component with specific UUID and state
- **Scenario**: The serialized representation of unit state for hibernation
- **IOR**: The reference system that connects units across the network

### **Integration with Web4 Architecture**

**My Understanding:**
Units integrate into the broader Web4 system through:

- **ONCE Kernel**: Universal communication engine manages unit lifecycle
- **Scenario System**: Units hibernate/restore through scenario serialization
- **IOR Network**: Units reference each other through IOR system
- **Layer Architecture**: Units respect layer separation for clean interfaces
- **Build System**: Units participate in progressive dependency resolution

### **Potential Gaps in My Understanding**

**What I'm Uncertain About:**
1. **The Single Precondition**: Not sure what this specific requirement is
2. **Self-Build Mechanics**: How exactly does the self-build process work?
3. **Unit Lifecycle**: How are units created, managed, and destroyed?
4. **Tool Integration**: How do units interact with the broader tool ecosystem?
5. **Practical Creation**: What are the actual steps to create a new unit?

### **Questions for Reality Check**

1. Is my understanding of "unit" as hibernatable, UUID-based objects correct?
2. What is the actual single precondition for using the tools?
3. How does the self-build mechanism really work?
4. What's the correct unit creation process?
5. How do units relate to the component versioning system?
