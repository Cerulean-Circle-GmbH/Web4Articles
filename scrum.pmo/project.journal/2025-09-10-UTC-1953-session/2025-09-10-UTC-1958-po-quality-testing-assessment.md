### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Critical Test Failure Resolution Priority**
  - a) Address scenario validation failures first (191 missing IOR/unitIndex properties)
  - b) Focus on ONCE component integration failures first (7 failed tests)
  - c) Systematic approach - fix both categories in parallel with separate tasks
  - d) Quick wins approach - fix test expectation mismatches first, then structural issues

- [ ] **Decision 2: Quality Strategy Implementation Approach**
  - a) Create emergency fix tasks for immediate test passing
  - b) Create comprehensive quality improvement epic for systematic resolution
  - c) Combined approach - emergency fixes + systematic quality framework
  - d) Focus on test infrastructure improvements before fixing individual tests

- [ ] **Decision 3: Extended Session Planning Structure**
  - a) Multi-day sprint cycles focusing on different quality aspects each day
  - b) Single comprehensive quality improvement sprint with multiple phases
  - c) Iterative daily cycles with continuous testing and validation
  - d) Milestone-based approach with specific quality gates

### **My Answer**
Based on your decisions for Quality/Testing Focus, PO role, and Extended multi-day session, I've conducted a comprehensive quality assessment. The test results reveal critical issues requiring systematic resolution: 191 scenario files missing required properties (IOR, unitIndex) and 7 ONCE component integration test failures. I'm presenting strategic decisions for prioritization and approach to ensure our extended session delivers maximum quality impact.

**Learning Applied:** Quality assessment reveals systemic issues requiring both immediate fixes and comprehensive quality framework implementation.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Quality Assessment Findings:**
1. **Critical Test Failures (7/15 tests failed):**
   - Scenario validation: 191 files missing IOR and unitIndex properties
   - ONCE component integration: CLI output format mismatches
   - Test expectation vs. actual behavior disconnects

2. **Systemic Quality Issues:**
   - Scenario schema validation failures indicate data integrity problems
   - ONCE component behavior changes not reflected in tests
   - Test count expectations outdated (expected <100, actual 191 files)

3. **Quality Infrastructure Analysis:**
   - Vitest properly configured with 30s timeouts
   - Test structure organized by domains (build, cli, integration, once, scenarios, services)
   - Package.json includes proper test scripts and dependencies

**Strategic Quality Focus Areas:**
- **Data Integrity:** Scenario file schema compliance
- **Component Integration:** ONCE CLI behavior validation
- **Test Maintenance:** Expectation alignment with actual system behavior
- **Quality Gates:** Systematic validation and regression prevention

**Extended Session Planning:**
- Multi-day approach enabling systematic quality improvements
- PO role ensuring implementation-ready task creation
- Quality/Testing focus addressing root causes, not just symptoms

## **🔧 DO** 

**Quality Assessment Execution:**
1. **Test Suite Analysis:** Executed `npm test` to identify current quality state
2. **Failure Pattern Recognition:** Identified two main categories of failures:
   - **Schema Validation Failures:** 191 scenario files missing required properties
   - **Integration Test Failures:** ONCE component output format mismatches

3. **Critical Failure Details Captured:**
   - **Scenario Validation:** Files missing "IOR" and "unitIndex" properties
   - **ONCE Deinstall Test:** Expected "comprehensive ecosystem deinstall" vs actual output
   - **ONCE Start Test:** Expected build chain messages vs actual kernel messages  
   - **ONCE Usage Test:** Expected specific help text vs actual CLI output format
   - **Seamless Execution Test:** Expected "Web4 ONCE CLI Tool" vs actual component header

4. **Quality Infrastructure Verification:**
   - Dependencies installed successfully (93 packages)
   - Vitest configuration validated
   - Test structure and organization assessed

**Strategic Analysis Completed:**
- Identified systematic vs. isolated issues
- Assessed impact on system reliability
- Evaluated test maintenance requirements
- Determined quality improvement opportunities
