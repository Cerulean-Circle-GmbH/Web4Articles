### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - This is a critical gap fix that must be implemented to prevent future agents from missing essential project technical context.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-2020)**
```quote
the new started Agent did not at all regard the tech stack of the project. find it and add it to the start procedure as mandatory read.
```

### **My Answer**
You're absolutely right! I completely missed the tech stack during startup, which explains gaps in my quality assessment. I found `docs/tech-stack.md` with critical constraints: Vitest mandatory (Jest BANNED), ESM-native TypeScript approach, Docker/Devcontainer environment, and PlantUML architecture. This technical context is essential for proper project understanding and should be mandatory reading in the startup procedure.

**Learning Applied:** Technical context and constraints are fundamental for proper project understanding and must be integrated into agent startup procedure.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Critical Tech Stack Information Missed:**

1. **Testing Framework Constraints:**
   - **Vitest**: Mandatory for all testing (ESM-native, TypeScript-first)
   - **Jest**: EXPLICITLY BANNED (marked as "evil" due to poor ESM support)
   - **Migration requirement**: All tests must use Vitest and ESM imports

2. **Technical Architecture:**
   - **ESM-native approach**: Modern JavaScript modules throughout
   - **TypeScript-first**: Primary development language
   - **Docker/Devcontainer**: Standardized development environment

3. **Tooling Requirements:**
   - **PlantUML + Graphviz**: Architecture diagram rendering
   - **GitHub CLI**: Repository automation
   - **Vite ecosystem**: Modern build tooling

**Impact of Missing Tech Stack Knowledge:**
- Quality assessment lacked technical context
- Test failure analysis missed framework constraints
- Solution recommendations could violate tech stack rules
- Overall project understanding incomplete

**Startup Procedure Enhancement Required:**
1. Add tech stack as mandatory read after PDCA guide
2. Include tech stack constraints in essential knowledge
3. Ensure technical context before quality assessments
4. Prevent future agents from same gap

## **🔧 DO** 

**Tech Stack Analysis Completed:**

**Critical Technical Constraints Identified:**
1. **Vitest Mandatory**: All testing must use Vitest framework
2. **Jest Explicitly Banned**: Marked as "evil" - immediate removal required if found
3. **ESM-Native**: Modern ES modules throughout project
4. **TypeScript-First**: Primary development approach
5. **Docker/Devcontainer**: Standardized environment approach

**Startup Procedure Gap Analysis:**
- Current README mentions PDCA guide but not tech stack
- Essential PDCA guide focuses on process but not technical constraints
- No technical context integration in startup flow
- Agent can begin work without understanding project technical foundation

**Integration Strategy Developed:**
1. **README Update**: Add tech stack as step 2.5 (between PDCA and session creation)
2. **Essential Guide Reference**: Link to tech stack from essential PDCA guide
3. **Mandatory Reading**: Make tech stack non-optional for startup
4. **Context Integration**: Ensure technical understanding before work begins

**Implementation Plan:**
- Update README.md with mandatory tech stack reading
- Add tech stack reference to essential PDCA guide
- Create clear technical context integration
- Ensure future agents cannot miss this critical information

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Technical Context Protocol**: Project tech stack and constraints must be mandatory reading before any work begins
- ✅ **Startup Procedure Enhancement**: Technical foundation knowledge prevents misaligned analysis and recommendations  
- ✅ **Quality Assessment Improvement**: Understanding technical constraints enables appropriate solution strategies
- ✅ **Collaborative Alignment**: Technical context ensures agent recommendations align with project architecture

**Quality Impact:** Tech stack integration into startup procedure ensures all future agents understand technical constraints before beginning work, preventing misaligned analysis and inappropriate recommendations.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implementation of tech stack integration into README and essential guide, ensuring technical context becomes mandatory startup knowledge.
