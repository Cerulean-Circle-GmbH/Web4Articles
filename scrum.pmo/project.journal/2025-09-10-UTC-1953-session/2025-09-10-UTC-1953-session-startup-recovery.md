  - a) Background Agent for coordination and process management
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to PO for requirement analysis and project management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-1953)**
```quote
sorry for the typo on my phone.
read the readme in the project root and recover
```

### **My Answer**
No problem! I've successfully read the README and initiated the recovery process according to the instructions. I've switched to the dev/once0304 branch as requested, initialized the PDCA framework, created the session directory, and now presenting the startup decision framework with the standard 3 questions for your guidance on focus area, role selection, and session duration.

**Learning Applied:** Following README recovery instructions ensures proper session initialization with PDCA compliance.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Recovery Process According to README:**
1. ✅ Initialize PDCA Framework - PDCA documentation exists and accessible
2. ✅ Read PDCA Guide - Comprehensive understanding of format and decision framework
3. ✅ Create Session Start PDCA - Using startup decision framework template
4. ✅ Project Status & Branch Management - Session directory created, on dev/once0304 branch

**Startup Decision Framework Application:**
- Present standard 3 decisions: Focus Area, Role Selection, Session Duration
- Use proper PDCA format with UTC timestamp
- Follow mobile-friendly numbered protocol for easy user response
- Maintain "NEVER 2 1 ALWAYS 4 2" principle - collaborative decision making

**Session Initialization Requirements:**
- Session directory: `2025-09-10-UTC-1953-session` ✅
- Project status file created ✅
- Working on dev/once0304 branch ✅
- PDCA framework properly initialized ✅

## **🔧 DO** 

**Recovery Actions Completed:**
1. **Branch Verification:** Confirmed on dev/once0304 branch as requested
2. **PDCA Framework Check:** Verified PDCA documentation exists at `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md`
3. **Documentation Review:** Read comprehensive PDCA guidelines and startup decision framework
4. **Session Setup:** Created timestamped session directory `2025-09-10-UTC-1953-session`
5. **Project Status:** Created `project.status.md` with current timestamp
6. **PDCA Creation:** Generated startup PDCA using template version 3.1.4.2

**Startup Decision Framework Implementation:**
- Applied standard 3-question format from `PDCA.howto.decide.md`
- Customized options based on current project context and available roles
- Used proper checkbox format with numbered protocol for mobile compatibility
- Included rationale and distinct outcomes for each decision option

**Process Compliance:**
- Following README instructions exactly as specified
- Using UTC timestamp format throughout
- Maintaining PDCA mandatory 6-section structure
- Ready to commit and push after user decisions
