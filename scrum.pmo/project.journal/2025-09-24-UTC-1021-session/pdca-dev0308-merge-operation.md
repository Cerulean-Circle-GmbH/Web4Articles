## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute safe and systematic merge of dev/0308 into current development branch

**Requirements Traceability:** User Request for Branch Integration + Git Best Practices

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Pre-merge Verification:** Check branch status, working directory cleanliness, and source branch availability
- **Content Analysis:** Review commits and file changes to understand merge scope and impact
- **Safe Merge Execution:** Use non-fast-forward merge with descriptive commit message
- **Conflict Resolution:** Address any merge conflicts systematically if they arise
- **Validation:** Verify merge completion and push changes to remote repository
- **Documentation:** Create comprehensive PDCA record for audit trail and learning

## **🔧 DO**

**Branch Merge Operation Execution**

**1. Pre-merge Verification**
```bash
# Verified current branch status
git status
# Result: On branch dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1021, working tree clean

# Confirmed current branch name
git branch --show-current
# Result: dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1021

# Located source branch availability
git branch -a | grep dev/0308
# Result: remotes/origin/dev/0308 (confirmed remote branch exists)
```

**2. Source Branch Analysis**
```bash
# Fetched latest version of source branch
git fetch origin dev/0308
# Result: Successfully fetched 97 objects, 21.83 KiB

# Analyzed commits to be merged
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/dev/0308 --max-count=10
# Result: 10 commits identified from 1c372268 to 00382b4d
# Content: Memory updates, safety protocols, CMM4 process patterns

# Reviewed files that will be affected
git diff --name-only HEAD...origin/dev/0308
# Result: 551+ files, mostly project journal entries, PDCA docs, memory files
```

**3. Merge Execution**
```bash
# Executed non-fast-forward merge with explicit message
git merge origin/dev/0308 --no-ff -m "Merge dev/0308: Memory updates, safety protocols, and PDCA documentation integration"
# Result: Successful merge with 551 files created, no conflicts

# Verified post-merge status
git status  
# Result: Clean working directory, 551 commits ahead of origin
```

**4. Remote Integration**
```bash
# Pushed merged changes to remote repository
git push
# Result: Successfully pushed to origin/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1021
# Delta: 4 objects compressed, 489 bytes transferred
```
