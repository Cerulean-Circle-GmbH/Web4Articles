## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute complete session startup protocol as defined in recovery documentation for background agent

**Requirements Traceability:** Recovery Protocol Documentation + Memory-Guided Preferences

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Environment Setup:** Source source.env for ONCE CLI tools (Memory: 7689399)
- **Branch Management:** Switch to save/start, create timestamped dev branch (Memory: 7495247)  
- **Documentation Framework:** Establish PDCA documentation structure (Memory: 6400956)
- **Automation Setup:** Install post-commit hook for seamless integration (Memory: 6291031)
- **Background Agent Optimization:** Ensure non-interactive operation (Memory: 7666404)

## **🔧 DO**

**Background Agent Session Recovery Protocol Execution**

**1. Environment and Context Setup**
```bash
# Sourced Web4Articles environment
source source.env
# Result: ✅ Web4Articles environment loaded, ONCE CLI tools available in PATH

# Verified workspace context
pwd # Result: /workspace

# Checked initial branch state  
git status # Result: On branch cursor/start-background-process-f02d
```

**2. Branch Management Following Memory Guidelines**
```bash
# Switched to main as project convention (Memory: 7495247)
git checkout main
# Result: Switched to branch 'main', up to date with origin/main

# Moved to save/start base branch
git checkout save/start  
# Result: Switched to new branch 'save/start', tracking origin/save/start

# Created timestamped development branch
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
# Result: Created and switched to dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1021

# Pushed branch with tracking setup
git push -u origin dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1021
# Result: ✅ Branch pushed and tracking configured
```

**3. Git Automation Installation**
```bash
# Created post-commit hook for auto-merge functionality
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
EOF

# Made hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
# Result: ✅ Post-commit hook installed and ready
```

**4. Session Documentation Infrastructure**
```bash
# Created session journal directory
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-1021-session
# Result: ✅ Session directory structure established

# Initiated TODO tracking for task management
# Result: ✅ Task management system active with background agent optimizations
```
