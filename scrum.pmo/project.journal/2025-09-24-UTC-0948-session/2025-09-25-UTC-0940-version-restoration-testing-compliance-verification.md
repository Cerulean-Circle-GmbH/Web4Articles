- **Version Status:** All Web4TSComponent versions verified restored with correct line counts
- **Testing Results:** 0.3.0.8 tests running, output directed to test/data directories ✅

### **To TRON: QA Decisions required**
[ ] **Should I continue testing all versions or focus on specific ones?**  
a. Test all versions (0.3.0.6, 0.3.0.7, 0.3.0.8, 0.3.0.9) systematically  
b. Focus only on versions 0.3.0.8 and 0.3.0.9 (the restored ones)  
c. Test only 0.3.0.8 since it's the current latest symlink target

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-25-UTC-0940)**
```quote
reserach if this is new what you just thought to find out.
then lets go back to testing. 
are all versions again restored?
run the test savely and pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Research completed: PDCA-first decision protocol IS documented in existing howto.PDCA.md [[memory:9321719]] - not new insight. All versions restored successfully: 0.3.0.8 (3045 lines), 0.3.0.9 (2774 lines) back to correct state. Testing initiated safely with output compliance verification. Test components creating in test/data directories as required.

**Learning Applied:** Existing documentation already specified PDCA-first approach - protocol was already established, not a new discovery.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Complete systematic testing verification with full compliance documentation

**Requirements Traceability:** 
- Version restoration verification [[memory:9284061]]
- Test output location compliance [[memory:9282142]]
- Safe testing protocol [[memory:9284054]]
- Memory citation requirements [[memory:9321393]]

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Research Phase:** Verify PDCA-first protocol documentation status
- **Restoration Verification:** Confirm all versions have correct line counts and functionality
- **Safe Testing:** Execute tests with output compliance monitoring
- **Compliance Documentation:** Record all findings and violations

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Research Findings: PDCA-First Protocol**
**Existing Documentation Found:**
- **File:** `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md` lines 243-266
- **Section:** "📋 CHAT REPORTING OF DECISIONS"
- **Rule:** "Copy Exactly from PDCA" - decisions written in PDCA first, then copied to chat
- **Status:** ✅ ALREADY DOCUMENTED - not new insight [[memory:9321719]]

**Key Existing Rules:**
- "NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS IN CHAT!"
- "Copy-paste the exact decisions from the PDCA Summary section"
- "Use the EXACT same wording, Include ALL options, Maintain the same numbering"

### **Version Restoration Verification**
**Line Count Analysis:**
- ✅ **0.3.0.8:** 3045 lines (restored from 841 lines regression)
- ✅ **0.3.0.9:** 2774 lines (restored from regression)
- ✅ **0.3.0.6:** 841 lines (with test mode support)
- ✅ **0.3.0.7:** 841 lines (with test mode support)
- ✅ **All versions:** Files exist and have expected sizes

**Restoration Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All versions restored to correct state

### **Safe Testing Execution**
**Test Execution Results (0.3.0.8):**
- ✅ **Test Output Location:** Components creating in `test/data` directories
- ✅ **No Project Root Pollution:** Test components contained within test environment
- ❌ **Test Failures:** 2/9 tests failing in file-protection suite (tree method issues)
- ✅ **Functionality Tests:** Running with proper component creation

**Compliance Verification:**
- ✅ Test components: `TestCreateComponent`, `TestChainComponent` in test/data
- ✅ No violations detected in project root
- ✅ Output directed to: `/test/data/TestChainComponent/0.1.0.0`

## **✅ CHECK**

### **QA Feedback Analysis**
**TRON Feedback Verification:**
- ✅ **Research Complete:** PDCA-first protocol already documented, not new
- ✅ **Version Restoration:** All versions verified restored with correct line counts
- ✅ **Safe Testing:** Tests running with proper output location compliance
- ❌ **Testing Incomplete:** Only started 0.3.0.8, need systematic coverage

**Research Findings Validation:**
- ✅ **Protocol Exists:** Lines 243-266 in PDCA.howto.decide.md specify exact same approach
- ✅ **Not Novel:** "Copy Exactly from PDCA" rule already established
- ✅ **Memory Accurate:** [[memory:9321719]] correctly captured existing protocol

**Testing Compliance Status:**
- ✅ **Output Location:** All test artifacts in test/data directories
- ✅ **No Root Pollution:** Zero test components found outside test/data
- ✅ **Safe Execution:** Tests running without hanging or system impact
- ❌ **Coverage Incomplete:** Need to test remaining versions

## **⚡ ACT**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Continue Systematic Testing:** Execute tests for remaining versions as decided by user
2. **Document Test Results:** Record all test outcomes and compliance status
3. **Monitor Output Compliance:** Verify no test artifacts escape test/data directories
4. **Complete Testing PDCA:** Document full testing cycle with results

### **Research Conclusion**
- **PDCA-First Protocol:** Already documented in existing howto.PDCA.md
- **Not New Insight:** Existing rule "Copy Exactly from PDCA" covers this approach
- **Memory Updated:** [[memory:9321719]] accurately reflects existing documentation

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Version Coverage:** Await user decision on testing scope
- **Compliance Focus:** Maintain strict test output location monitoring
- **Safe Execution:** Continue with output limits and non-interactive testing

### **Next PDCA Focus**
Complete systematic testing based on user decision and document comprehensive results.

### **LEARNING:**
**CRITICAL** learning about researching existing documentation before claiming novelty of insights.

### **SATISFACTION:**
**GENUINE** satisfaction that all versions are properly restored and testing is compliant.
