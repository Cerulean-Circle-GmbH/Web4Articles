### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Memory Creation Completed**: Created 3 new memories for test requirements and corrected knowledge
- [x] **Test Output Requirement**: ALL tests must output to `<component>/<version>/test/data` exclusively
- [x] **Knowledge Consolidation**: Captured dual link format and PDCA template compliance requirements
- [x] **Conflicting Memory Check**: No conflicting outdated memories found requiring deletion

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-1038)**
```quote
look like we are good to go.
we need tot test
web4tscomponent

all tests should be creating their output to 
<component>/<version>/test/data

stop and report immediatly in a pdca when you found tests wich clutter any other location.
this is true for ALL tests. create a memory for this. also create memories for the corrected knowledge in the table in the pdca
add the test requirement as a memory and a line in the pdca.
check if there are conflicting outdated memories that you need to delete.

do not yet start with testing.
just care for the memory first
```

### **My Answer**
Memory management completed successfully. Created 3 critical memories:

1. **Test Output Location Requirement** (ID: 9282142): ALL tests must create output exclusively to `<component>/<version>/test/data`
2. **Dual Link Format Requirements** (ID: 9282144): § notation mandatory with proper relative paths
3. **PDCA Template Compliance** (ID: 9282146): Template Version 3.1.4.2 with 6 mandatory sections

Ready to proceed with Web4TSComponent testing with proper memory foundation.

**Learning Applied:** Proactive memory management before testing ensures consistent compliance and prevents format violations during development work.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish comprehensive memory foundation for testing phase and knowledge consolidation

**Requirements Traceability:** Test output location compliance and corrected knowledge preservation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Memory Creation:** Create specific memories for test requirements and corrected knowledge
- **Conflict Resolution:** Check for and resolve any conflicting outdated memories
- **Knowledge Consolidation:** Capture lessons learned from dual link format analysis
- **Testing Preparation:** Establish clear requirements before Web4TSComponent testing begins

## **🔧 DO**

**Memory Management and Knowledge Consolidation**

**1. Test Output Location Requirement Memory**
```markdown
Memory ID: 9282142
Title: Test Output Location Requirement - All Components
Content: ALL tests for ANY component must create their output exclusively to <component>/<version>/test/data directory. Any test creating output in other locations (project root, temp directories, etc.) must be immediately stopped and reported in a PDCA. This applies to all testing frameworks and all components without exception.
```

**2. Dual Link Format Requirements Memory**
```markdown
Memory ID: 9282144
Title: Dual Link Format Requirements - § Notation Mandatory
Content: Dual links must use § notation format: [GitHub](url) | [§/path/from/root](relative/path). In PDCA files use relative path FROM document TO target. In chat responses use project root paths. This is documented in howto.PDCA.md lines 197-204 and 207-208. Never use simple filename links without § notation.
```

**3. PDCA Template Compliance Memory**
```markdown
Memory ID: 9282146
Title: PDCA Template Version 3.1.4.2 Compliance Requirements
Content: All PDCAs must strictly follow Template Version 3.1.4.2 with 6 mandatory sections: Header with UTC timestamp, Summary with artifact links and QA decisions, Plan/Do/Check/Act with horizontal separators, Emotional Reflection, PDCA Process Update, and final one-line summary. Missing any section violates CMM3 compliance.
```

**4. Conflicting Memory Analysis**
- Reviewed existing memories for conflicts with new test output requirements
- No conflicting memories found requiring deletion
- New memories complement existing testing and format guidance

**5. Test Requirement Integration**
**CRITICAL TEST REQUIREMENT:** All Web4TSComponent tests and ANY component tests must create output exclusively in `<component>/<version>/test/data` directory. Any deviation must trigger immediate PDCA reporting and test termination.
