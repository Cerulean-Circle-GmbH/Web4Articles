# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Path Fix Status Investigation**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-09-25-UTC-1045  
**🎯 Objective:** Investigate if path fixes were already applied and lost, or only planned  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1.4.2  

**👤 Agent Name:** Claude → Path Fix Status Investigation Specialist  
**👤 Agent Role:** Developer → Test Implementation History Analysis  
**👤 Branch:** dev/0308 → Session continuation with fix status verification  
**🔄 Sync Requirements:** Determine if fixes were applied and reverted or never implemented  

**📎 Previous Commit:** d4288627 - Table manually rewritten: Clean 15 failed test entries, removed chaotic duplicates, user requirements met

**🚨 Issues:** Need to determine if path expectation fixes were implemented and lost during git operations

**User Question:**
```
so did you only plan to fix it or did you already fix it and lost it.
```

**QA Decisions:**
[ ] **Decision 1:** Fix Status Investigation  
a. Check if path expectation fixes were previously implemented  
b. Determine if fixes were lost during git operations or never applied  
c. Identify current state of test expectation paths  

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Investigation Strategy**

**Critical Questions:**
1. **Were fixes applied?** Check if `existsSync` calls were updated to use `testDataDir` paths
2. **Were fixes lost?** Determine if git operations reverted working fixes
3. **Current state?** Identify which paths are still broken

**Evidence to Check:**
- Current test file content for path formats
- Git history for path fix implementations
- Previous PDCA claims about 13 passing tests

**Expected Patterns:**
- **Fixed:** `path.join(testDataDir, 'components', ...)`
- **Broken:** `components/${componentName}/...` or hardcoded project root paths

---

## **📋 DO**

### **Current Test File Analysis**

**Checking Line 85-86 (should create component with intelligent defaults):**
```typescript
const componentPath = `components/${componentName}/0.1.0.0`; // ❌ BROKEN - hardcoded project root
expect(existsSync(componentPath)).toBe(true);
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Line 85: Uses hardcoded `components/${componentName}/0.1.0.0` format
- This is the **BROKEN** pattern causing test failures
- Should be: `path.join(testDataDir, 'components', componentName, version)`

### **Investigation Results**

**Evidence Found:**
- Tests still use hardcoded `components/...` paths
- No evidence of systematic path fixes being applied
- targetDirectory approach is working (component creation successful)
- Test expectations never updated to match

**Previous Claims Analysis:**
- Earlier PDCA claimed "13 passing, 15 failing"
- This may have been projected/planned results, not actual achieved results
- Actual test run shows same 15 failures as table indicates

---

## **📋 CHECK**

**User Question Analysis:**

> "so did you only plan to fix it or did you already fix it and lost it."

**Investigation Results:**

**Status: ONLY PLANNED, NEVER IMPLEMENTED**

**Evidence:**
1. **Current Test Code:** Still contains broken hardcoded paths (`components/${componentName}/0.1.0.0`)
2. **Test Results:** 15 failures match exactly what broken paths would cause
3. **No Git Evidence:** No commits showing systematic path expectation fixes
4. **Pattern Consistent:** All failing tests use same broken path pattern

**Root Cause:** Path expectation fixes were **planned and documented** but **never actually implemented** in the test files.

**Previous PDCA Status:** The "13 passing, 15 failing" status was likely:
- Projected results if fixes were applied
- Misreported status during rapid iterations
- Not actual measured results from test execution

---

## **📋 ACT**

### **Status Confirmed: Fixes Never Implemented**

**Answer to User Question:**
**ONLY PLANNED** - The path fixes were never actually implemented, just planned and documented.

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ targetDirectory approach working (component creation in test/data)
- ❌ Test expectations never updated to match
- ❌ All 15 tests still use broken hardcoded paths
- ❌ No systematic fix implementation occurred

### **Next Actions Required**

**Immediate Fix Needed:**
1. **Update Test Expectations** - Change all `existsSync` calls to use `testDataDir` paths
2. **Systematic Pattern Fix** - Replace `components/${name}/...` with `path.join(testDataDir, 'components', name, ...)`
3. **Verify Results** - Run tests to confirm 13 passing, 15 failing becomes 28 passing

### **Learning Applied**

**Status Verification:** [[memory:9283312]] - Always measure actual results, not projected ones
**Implementation Gap:** Planning ≠ Implementation - must verify code changes actually applied
**Git History:** Check actual commits for evidence of claimed fixes

---

### **🔄 PDCA Process Update**

**Compliance Check:** Template 3.1.4.2 ✅, Investigation complete ✅, Fix implementation required

**Next Cycle:** Implement actual path expectation fixes in test files

---

**📊 One-line Summary:** Path fixes were only planned, never implemented - test expectations still use broken hardcoded paths causing 15 failures. 📋❌
