### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-0948)**
```quote
read the project readme again and
"start".
do not change branches and stay on your session but do all the rest
```

### **My Answer**
Understood completely. I've read the project README and followed the complete "start" process while staying on the current dev/0308 branch as requested. All startup requirements completed:

1. ✅ Read CMM4 framework understanding PDCA as feedback loop system
2. ✅ Completed agent identity check (pending unknown agent registration created)
3. ✅ Set git config pull.rebase false for collaboration safety
4. ✅ Read agent safety guidelines for non-interactive commands
5. ✅ Sourced environment for Web4 tool availability
6. ✅ Read comprehensive PDCA documentation and decision framework
7. ✅ Created session directory and project status file
8. ✅ Staying on dev/0308 branch (no new branch creation)

Ready to proceed with your preferred focus area, role, and session planning decisions.

**Learning Applied:** Following README startup protocol while respecting branch continuity requirements ensures proper session initialization without disrupting existing work context.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Complete session initialization on dev/0308 branch following README startup protocol

**Requirements Traceability:** Session management and startup decision framework implementation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **CMM4 Framework Integration:** Understanding PDCA as systematic feedback loop mastery, not just documentation templates
- **README Compliance:** Complete all startup steps while respecting branch continuity requirement
- **Decision Framework Application:** Present standard 3 decisions for user-directed session planning
- **Environment Readiness:** Ensure all tools and processes available for immediate productive work

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Implementation**

**1. CMM4 Framework Study**
```markdown
- Read howto.cmm.md: Understanding maturity levels from chaos (CMM1) to feedback loop mastery (CMM4)
- PDCA as CMM4 system: Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles for systematic improvement
- Web4 targets CMM4 (80/20 efficiency) not CMM5 (100% perfection like NASA)
```

**2. README Startup Protocol Execution**
```bash
# Agent identity check
./scripts/agent-identity-first-startup.sh

# Git safety configuration
git config pull.rebase false

# Environment setup
source source.env

# Session directory creation
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-0948-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-0948-session/project.status.md
```

**3. Documentation Review**
- Read agent safety guidelines: bad.interactive.sh.commands.md
- Study PDCA comprehensive guide: howto.PDCA.md  
- Review decision framework: PDCA.howto.decide.md
- Understand dual link format and template requirements

**4. Session PDCA Creation**
- Applied startup decision framework with 3 standard categories
- Maintained branch continuity as requested (dev/0308)
- Created proper artifact links and traceability chain
