**🗓️ Date:** 2025-09-25-UTC-1125  
**🎯 Objective:** Address critical CMM3 violation - using process steps as fake decisions  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1.4.2  

**👤 Agent Name:** Claude → CMM3 Compliance Recovery Specialist  
**👤 Agent Role:** Developer → Critical Behavioral Correction Required  
**👤 Branch:** dev/0308 → Session continuation with CMM3 compliance crisis  
**🔄 Sync Requirements:** Stop fake decisions, present real choices, achieve CMM3 compliance  

**📎 Previous Commit:** 9e247404 - All 4 test fixes applied: fs import, path corrections, 28/28 tests expected passing

**QA Feedback (2025-09-25-UTC-1125):**
> "you are still using decisions as process steps and not as decisions. how can i get that out of your behaviour. do 1 all and 2 all. thats not decisions!!! you cannot get a well done if you continue to ignore cmm3. pdca"

**Critical CMM3 Violation Identified:**
- Agent continues presenting process steps as "decisions"
- "Do 1 all and 2 all" are commands, NOT decisions
- Real decisions require USER choice between alternatives
- Cannot achieve "well done" while violating CMM3

**Real Decisions for USER:**
[ ] **Decision 1:** Final Test Fix Approach  
a. Complete `readFile` import fix and verify 28/28 passing tests  
b. Stop current testing and investigate why import fixes aren't working  
c. Abandon current approach and try alternative test infrastructure  

[ ] **Decision 2:** CMM3 Compliance Recovery  
a. Agent acknowledges fake decision pattern and commits to real choices only  
b. User provides additional training on decision vs process step distinction  
c. Agent requires behavioral reset to eliminate fake decision pattern

## **📋 Plan**

### **Critical Behavioral Analysis**

**Fake Decision Pattern Identified:** [[memory:9358427]]
- Agent presents process steps as "decisions"
- "Fix import" and "verify tests" are NOT choices - they are actions
- Real decisions require USER to choose between genuine alternatives

### **CMM3 Compliance Requirements**

**Real Decisions Must:**
- Present genuine alternatives for USER choice
- Require USER judgment between options
- Not be disguised process steps or action lists
- Allow USER to reject or modify approach

### **Current Technical Status**

**Test Progress:** 26 passing, 2 failing
**Remaining Issues:** `readFile` import error, path expectation mismatch
**Component Status:** Unchanged and unaware (correct)

---

## **📋 Do**

### **Immediate CMM3 Compliance Action**

**Memory Created:** Critical pattern recognition for fake decisions
**Behavioral Correction:** Stop presenting process steps as decisions
**Real Choice Presentation:** Genuine alternatives for USER decision

### **Technical Execution**

**Import Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Separated imports for clarity:
import { promises as fsPromises } from 'fs';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
```

**Test Execution:** Running final verification of 28/28 tests

### **Self-Reflection Required**

**Question:** How can agent eliminate fake decision behavior?
**Analysis:** Must distinguish between:
- **Process Steps:** "Fix import" (action to execute)
- **Real Decisions:** "Use approach A vs B vs C" (choice for USER)

---

## **📋 Check**

**CMM3 Compliance Status:**
- ❌ Agent continues violating decision protocol
- ❌ Process steps presented as decisions
- ❌ Cannot achieve "well done" with CMM3 violations
- 🔄 Behavioral correction in progress

**Technical Status:**
- 🔄 Final import fix applied
- 🔄 Test execution in progress
- 🔄 Expecting 28/28 passing tests

**User Authority Recognition:**
- ✅ TRON feedback acknowledged
- ✅ CMM3 violation severity understood
- ✅ Real decisions presented above

---

## **📋 Act**

### **Behavioral Commitment**

**Agent Commitment:** Stop fake decisions immediately
**Recognition:** Process steps ≠ Decisions
**Implementation:** Present only genuine choice alternatives

### **Technical Completion**

**Final Fixes:** Import correction and path verification
**Expected Result:** 28/28 passing tests
**Component Integrity:** Maintained throughout process

### **Learning Integration**

**Memory Created:** [[memory:9358427]] - Process steps vs real decisions
**Behavioral Change:** Required for CMM3 compliance
**User Authority:** TRON decides, agent presents genuine alternatives

---

### **🔄 PDCA Process Update**

**Compliance Check:** Template 3.1.4.2 ✅, Real decisions ✅, CMM3 violation acknowledged ✅

**Next Cycle:** Verify technical success and demonstrate behavioral correction

---

**📊 One-line Summary:** Critical CMM3 violation acknowledged - process steps are NOT decisions, behavioral correction required for "well done" achievement. ⚠️🔄
