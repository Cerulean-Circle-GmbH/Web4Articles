**🗓️ Date:** 2025-09-25-UTC-1035  
**🎯 Objective:** Manually rewrite table with exactly 15 failed test entries, clean format  
**🎯 Template Version:** 3.1.4.2  

**👤 Agent Name:** Claude → Table Manual Rewrite Specialist  
**👤 Agent Role:** Developer → Clean Table Structure Implementation  
**👤 Branch:** dev/0308 → Session continuation with manual table correction  
**🔄 Sync Requirements:** Chaotic 91-line table → Clean 15-entry failed tests table  

**📎 Previous Commit:** 558b097a - Table content corrected: Show only 15 failed tests, removed chaotic mixed entries

**User Decision Implemented:**
- **Decision 1a:** Manually rewrite entire table with only 15 failed test entries

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Manual Rewrite Strategy**

**Target Structure:**
- Header: "28 tests total, 13 passed, 15 failed (53.6% failure rate)"
- Table: Exactly 15 failed test entries only
- Format: Clean detailed structure with consistent formatting
- Line Count: Minimal, focused on failed tests requiring analysis

**Content Selection:**
- Remove all passing tests from detailed table (success doesn't need analysis)
- Show only failed tests with detailed root cause analysis
- Maintain line numbers, dual links, and granular analysis structure
- Consistent emoji and status formatting

---

## **📋 DO**

### **Complete Table Rewrite Executed**

**New Structure Applied:**
- ✅ Header shows correct "13 passed, 15 failed" summary
- ✅ Table contains exactly 15 failed test entries
- ✅ Removed all chaotic duplicates and mixed formats
- ✅ Clean consistent formatting throughout

**Content Organization:**
- **Lines 1-6:** Header and metadata
- **Lines 7-21:** Clean table with 15 failed test entries only
- **Total:** Approximately 21 lines (clean, focused structure)

**Format Compliance:**
- ✅ Detailed table structure maintained
- ✅ Line numbers and dual links preserved
- ✅ Granular root cause analysis for each failed test
- ✅ Consistent emoji usage (🚫 TEST BROKEN, ✅ Mocking, 📋 Path align)

---

## **📋 CHECK**

**User Requirements Verification:**

> "should have '13 passed, 15 failed'"

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Header correctly shows "28 tests total, 13 passed, 15 failed (53.6% failure rate)"

> "15 lines"

**Status:** ✅ ACHIEVED - Table now contains exactly 15 failed test entries in clean format

**Quality Verification:**
- ✅ No duplicate entries
- ✅ No mixed format chaos
- ✅ Consistent structure throughout
- ✅ Only failed tests in detailed analysis section
- ✅ Clean, readable format

**Content Accuracy:**
- ✅ All 15 failed tests properly documented
- ✅ Root cause analysis maintained for each entry
- ✅ Line numbers and dual links accurate
- ✅ Status indicators consistent

---

## **📋 ACT**

### **Manual Rewrite Completed Successfully**

**Achieved Results:**
1. **Clean Structure** ✅
   - Removed 91-line chaotic format
   - Created focused 15-entry failed tests table
   - Eliminated all duplicates and mixed formats

2. **User Requirements Met** ✅
   - Header shows "13 passed, 15 failed" ✅
   - Table contains exactly 15 failed test entries ✅
   - Clean, organized format ✅

3. **Format Compliance Maintained** ✅
   - Detailed table structure preserved
   - Line numbers and dual links intact
   - Granular root cause analysis for each failed test
   - Consistent emoji and status formatting

### **Quality Improvements**

**Before:** 91 lines with chaotic duplicates and mixed formats
**After:** ~21 lines with clean, focused structure showing only failed tests

**Content Focus:** Only tests requiring detailed analysis (failed tests) shown in table, passing tests summarized in header only

### **Learning Applied**

**Table Organization:** Show detailed analysis only for items needing attention (failed tests)
**Manual Correction:** Sometimes complete rewrite is more effective than incremental fixes
**User Requirements:** Exact compliance with "15 lines" and "13 passed, 15 failed" specifications

---

### **🔄 PDCA Process Update**

**Compliance Check:** Template 3.1.4.2 ✅, User requirements ✅, Clean format ✅

**Next Cycle:** Continue systematic testing with clean format maintained across all versions

---

**📊 One-line Summary:** Table manually rewritten with exactly 15 failed test entries, clean format achieved, user requirements met completely. ✅📋
