## **Memory References Created**

### **Memory ID: 9282142 - Test Output Location Requirement**
**Title:** Test Output Location Requirement - All Components  
**Content:** ALL tests for ANY component must create their output exclusively to `<component>/<version>/test/data` directory. Any test creating output in other locations must be immediately stopped and reported in a PDCA. User requirement established in [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/0308/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-0948-session/2025-09-24-UTC-1038-memory-management-test-requirements.md) | [ยง/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-0948-session/2025-09-24-UTC-1038-memory-management-test-requirements.md](2025-09-24-UTC-1038-memory-management-test-requirements.md).

### **Memory ID: 9282144 - Dual Link Format Requirements**
**Title:** Dual Link Format Requirements - ยง Notation Mandatory  
**Content:** Dual links must use ยง notation format: [GitHub](url) | [ยง/path/from/root](relative/path). In PDCA files use relative path FROM document TO target. In chat responses use project root paths. This is documented in [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/0308/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md#L192-L218) | [ยง/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md](../../roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) lines 192-218.

### **Memory ID: 9282146 - PDCA Template Compliance**
**Title:** PDCA Template Version 3.1.4.2 Compliance Requirements  
**Content:** All PDCAs must strictly follow Template Version 3.1.4.2 with 6 mandatory sections. Template and requirements documented in [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/0308/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) | [ยง/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md](../../roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/0308/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md) | [ยง/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md](../../roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md).
