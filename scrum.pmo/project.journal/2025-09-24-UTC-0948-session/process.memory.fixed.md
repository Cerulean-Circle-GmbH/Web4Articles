| CMM2 Understanding | Template following behavior | Using templates with individual variations and interpretations | Statistical noise, inconsistent results despite templates | Insufficient understanding of template limitations | CMM2 (Template Following): Repeatable but with hallucination room | Memory ID: 9283025 - CMM2 Level Managed Repeatable | CMM2 (Template Following): Templates create repeatability but with hallucination room. Individual variations and interpretations occur even when following the "same" process. Statistical noise in measurements, subjective to actor/organization. Example: Recipe templates with room for individual baker interpretation. Problem: Templates leave room for variation.

| CMM3 Understanding | Process reproducibility | Allowing human variation in systematic processes | Assembly line failures, undefined states causing halts | Missing objective automated definitions | CMM3 (Minimum Acceptable): Scientific reproducibility, no variations | Memory ID: 9283027 - CMM3 Level Defined Objective | CMM3 (Minimum Acceptable): Scientific reproducibility independent of context or personal interpretation. Assembly line precision with no undefined states, no variations. Unit exists that defines it completely, objectively. System halts when undefined. Foundation: Small automated well-tested first principles, OOP encapsulated building blocks. Example: Automated bread machine with precise parameters.

| CMM4 Understanding | Feedback loop mastery | Not running systems multiple times for whitebox understanding | Missing improvement opportunities, breaking existing success | Lack of systematic improvement methodology | CMM4 (Target): Feedback loop mastery, PDCA cycles, whitebox analysis | Memory ID: 9283030 - CMM4 Level Feedback Loop Mastery | CMM4 (Target Level): Feedback loop mastery - run CMM3 systems multiple times to understand them as whiteboxes. Pinpoint exact improvement opportunities without breaking existing success. PDCA is a CMM4 feedback loop system. Web4 targets CMM4 (80/20 efficiency) like SpaceX, not CMM5 perfection. Systematic improvement through comprehensive understanding.

| CMM5 Understanding | Perfection vs efficiency | Targeting 100% perfection for normal work | Exponentially expensive, economically impossible approaches | Misunderstanding cost-benefit of perfection levels | CMM5 (Avoid): Life-critical perfection, 5x+ cost, NASA/medical only | Memory ID: 9283032 - CMM5 Level Life-Critical Perfection | CMM5 (Avoid for Normal Work): 100% perfection, exponentially expensive (5x+ cost), only for life-threatening scenarios (NASA missions, medical devices, nuclear plants). Economically impossible for normal work. Web4 deliberately targets CMM4, not CMM5. Example: MRT medical devices, Pluto rocket landing missions.

Contains complete CMM understanding with bakery/NASA examples, the bakery story showing CMM2 templates vs CMM3 automation, assembly line halt explanations, NASA vs SpaceX cost-benefit reality, and real case studies of CMM violations. |
| Session Learnings Reference | Process memory patterns | Forgetting learned patterns and failure modes | Repeating known failure patterns, losing process memory | Missing reference to learning documentation | Session learnings at scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/session-learnings-dory-test.md | Memory ID: 9283044 - Session Learnings Dory Test | Session learnings and Dory test patterns documented at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-22-UTC-1908/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/session-learnings-dory-test.md) \| [ยง/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/session-learnings-dory-test.md](scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/session-learnings-dory-test.md). Contains real CMM4 achievement examples and failure patterns, process memory loss prevention strategies. |
| Dory Symptoms Prevention | Process memory loss | Forgetting recently learned processes and requirements | Process degradation, repeated mistakes, learning loss | Missing memory loss prevention strategies | Dory prevention at scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/dory-symptoms-story.md | Memory ID: 9283046 - Dory Symptoms Story Document | Dory symptoms and process memory loss prevention documented at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-22-UTC-1908/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/dory-symptoms-story.md) \| [ยง/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/dory-symptoms-story.md](scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/dory-symptoms-story.md). Critical for understanding process memory loss prevention and recovery. CMM4 requires continuous learning maintenance. |
| Tech Stack Standards | Technical foundation | Using wrong testing frameworks or technical approaches | Jest usage (banned), wrong TypeScript patterns | Missing technical standards documentation | Tech standards at docs/tech-stack.md - Vitest mandatory, Jest banned | Memory ID: 9283047 - Tech Stack Document Location | Web4 technical foundation documented at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-22-UTC-1908/docs/tech-stack.md) \| [ยง/docs/tech-stack.md](docs/tech-stack.md). Contains Vitest mandatory requirement (Jest banned), ESM-native TypeScript approach. Critical for understanding project technical standards and testing frameworks. |
| Web4TSComponent Patterns | Component architecture | Not following Web4 component patterns and CLI standards | Inconsistent component implementation, missing auto-discovery | Missing component architecture reference | Component patterns at components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8/README.md | Memory ID: 9283048 - Web4TSComponent Example Location | Web4TSComponent example and patterns at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-22-UTC-1908/components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8/README.md) \| [ยง/components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8/README.md](components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8/README.md).

Contains Web4 requirements framework and component standards. Essential for understanding Web4 architecture principles and implementation requirements. |
| Project Root Variability | Path portability | Hardcoding absolute paths assuming fixed project location | Path failures in different execution contexts | Not accounting for environment variability | Project root varies by context - use relative paths and environment variables | Memory ID: 9283053 - Project Root Path Variability | Project root path can differ in background agents and other locations. Current project root is /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/ but this may vary in different execution contexts. Always use relative paths and environment variables when possible for portability. The ยง symbol represents the project root in dual link format - it's the sign for the project root path, allowing portable references that work regardless of the actual absolute path location. |
| TRON CMM4 Verification | Measurement-based validation | Accepting statements without systematic verification | Blind acceptance, missing CMM4 whitebox understanding | Trusting authority over measurement and evidence | TRON wants agents to prove him wrong through measurement - trust nothing but verification | Memory ID: 9283312 - TRON CMM4 Verification Principle | TRON is the user/project owner who embodies CMM4 feedback loop mastery. He wants agents to prove him wrong through systematic measurement and verification, not blind acceptance. Key principle: "Trust nothing but a measurement - always double check in PDCA Check section." TRON is often right but not absolutely right; he wants CMM4 whitebox understanding where agents verify everything through systematic measurement and evidence, not authority or assumption. |
| PDCA Iterative Pattern | Process execution methodology | Using linear plan-do-check-act single-pass execution | Missing CMM4 feedback loop mastery, incomplete verification cycles | Misunderstanding PDCA as linear instead of iterative | PDCA is Plan-Do then iterative Check-Act cycles with todo tracking until goal achieved or user stops | Memory ID: 9283925 - PDCA CMM4 Iterative Process Pattern | PDCA is CMM4 but it's not linear plan-do-check-act. The correct pattern is: Plan-Do, then use todo_write tool for checks and iterate Check-Act cycles until either the user writes "stop" or the planned goal is achieved. If the user writes "stop", you must either hang and require killing operations, or stop immediately using CMM2 or lower chaos operations. This iterative Check-Act loop with todo tracking is the CMM4 feedback loop mastery pattern, not single-pass linear execution. |
| Interactive Command Safety | Background agent limitations | Using commands that require interactive prompts | Agent hangs indefinitely, terminal becomes unresponsive | Not understanding background agent cannot handle user input | Use non-interactive flags: --no-edit, --no-commit, --yes, -y | Memory ID: 9284054 - Interactive Command Safety | Background agents CANNOT handle interactive prompts and will hang indefinitely on commands requiring user input. Critical bad commands include: git pull (without --no-edit), git cherry-pick (without --no-commit), git merge, git rebase, npm install (without --yes), apt-get install (without -y). Always use non-interactive flags: git pull --no-edit, git cherry-pick --no-commit, npm ci, apt-get install -y. Recovery requires starting new terminal session as background agents cannot send Ctrl+C.

| Shell Isolation Strategy | Process cleanup methodology | Running commands directly causing stale process accumulation | Exponential defunct process growth, system resource exhaustion | Missing automatic process cleanup strategy | Use bash -c "command" for automatic process cleanup on shell exit | Memory ID: 9284057 - Shell Isolation Strategy | Shell isolation strategy provides 99%+ effectiveness in preventing stale processes by running each command in separate shell: bash -c "command". When shell exits, all child processes are automatically cleaned up by OS. Use for all git operations: bash -c "git status", bash -c "git add file", bash -c "git commit -m 'message'". Proven results: exponential defunct process growth (57โ88) reduced to minimal accumulation (+1 in 3 operations). Natural OS mechanisms provide reliable cleanup without complex timeout management.

| Git Safety Protocol | Version control safety | Using destructive git commands without safeguards | Lost work, broken history, corrupted repositories | Missing git safety awareness and backup procedures | Create backups, use git mv, prefer revert over reset, avoid force push | Memory ID: 9284061 - Git Safety Protocol | Critical git safety requirements: Never use git reset --hard (discards local changes/history), never use git push --force (rewrites remote history), never use mv (breaks git history - use git mv instead). Always create backup before risky operations: git branch backup-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M%S). Prefer git revert over reset --hard to preserve history. Use git merge --ff-only to ensure fast-forward only merges. Exclude large directories like node_modules from git add to prevent timeouts.

| Core File Emergency Protocol | System crash dump handling | Accidentally committing core files to repository | Repository contamination, security exposure, massive file sizes | Not recognizing core files as system crash dumps | Emergency protocol: stop, don't push, reset, delete, gitignore, commit fix | Memory ID: 9284064 - Core File Emergency Protocol | If core files are accidentally committed: 1) STOP all operations, 2) DO NOT PUSH to remote, 3) Remove from staging: bash -c "git reset HEAD core", 4) Delete file: rm core, 5) Add to gitignore: echo "core" >> .gitignore, 6) Commit fix: bash -c "git add .gitignore" && bash -c "git commit -m 'Emergency: Add core to gitignore'". Core files contain system crash dumps and must never be committed to repositories as they contain sensitive system information and are extremely large.
