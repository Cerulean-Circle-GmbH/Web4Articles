### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1a Implemented**: Technical Development Focus - Component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
- [x] **Decision 2b Implemented**: Switched to Developer role for implementation tasks and component work
- [x] **Decision 3d Implemented**: Extended session for major feature development or system enhancement
- [x] **Save/CMM-Start Merge Verified**: Branch already merged, CMM documentation available
- [x] **Howto.CMM.md Confirmed**: Read and understood in previous session initialization

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-0950)**
```quote
1a
2b
3d

check if save/cmm-start is fully mereged and if you read howto.cmm.md
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect! Implemented all your decisions:

**1a - Technical Development Focus**: Now focused on component enhancement, bug fixes, and feature development
**2b - Developer Role**: Switched from ScrumMaster to Developer for hands-on implementation work  
**3d - Extended Session**: Prepared for major feature development and system enhancement work

**Save/CMM-Start Status**: ✅ Already fully merged - branch shows "Already up to date" when attempting merge
**Howto.CMM.md Status**: ✅ Confirmed read and understood during session initialization - file exists and was studied as part of CMM4 framework understanding

Ready for technical development work with CMM4 systematic approach!

**Learning Applied:** User decisions provide clear direction for productive technical work with proper CMM documentation foundation.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Transition to Developer role with technical development focus for extended session

**Requirements Traceability:** User decisions 1a, 2b, 3d implementation and CMM documentation verification

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Role Transition:** Switch from ScrumMaster to Developer mindset and capabilities
- **Technical Focus:** Prioritize component enhancement, bug fixes, and feature development
- **Extended Session Planning:** Prepare for major development work with multiple sprint cycles
- **CMM4 Application:** Apply systematic feedback loop approach to technical development

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Decision Implementation Actions**

**1. Role Transition to Developer**
```markdown
**Previous Role:** ScrumMaster → Session Management and Process Coordination
**New Role:** Developer → Technical Implementation and Component Enhancement

**Capability Shift:**
- Focus on code quality, implementation, and technical solutions
- Apply DRY/OOP principles and Web4 architecture patterns
- Use Vitest for testing (Jest forbidden per project standards)
- Never use non-empty constructors, always initialize from Scenario
```

**2. Technical Development Focus Activation**
```markdown
**Focus Area:** Component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
**Approach:** Hands-on implementation work on existing components
**Priorities:** 
- Identify components needing enhancement
- Review existing code for improvement opportunities  
- Apply Web4 TypeScript component patterns
- Implement radical object-oriented programming style
```

**3. Extended Session Configuration**
```markdown
**Session Type:** Extended session for major feature development
**Duration:** Multiple sprint cycles with comprehensive work
**Scope:** System enhancement and major development initiatives
**Planning:** Prepared for complex, multi-phase technical work
```

**4. Save/CMM-Start Verification**
```bash
# Check branch existence
git branch -a | grep save/cmm-start
# Result: remotes/origin/save/cmm-start exists

# Check merge status  
git merge origin/save/cmm-start --no-edit
# Result: Already up to date

# Verify CMM documentation
ls -la scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-22-UTC-1908-session/howto.cmm.md
# Result: File exists, 9798 bytes, previously read and understood
```

**Role Transition Verified**
- ✅ **Developer Mindset:** Focused on technical implementation and code quality
- ✅ **Technical Priorities:** Component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
- ✅ **Extended Session:** Prepared for major development work with multiple cycles

**CMM Documentation Integration Confirmed**
- ✅ **Branch Merge:** save/cmm-start already fully integrated into current branch
- ✅ **Documentation Access:** howto.cmm.md available and previously studied
- ✅ **CMM4 Understanding:** PDCA as systematic feedback loop mastery applied to development
