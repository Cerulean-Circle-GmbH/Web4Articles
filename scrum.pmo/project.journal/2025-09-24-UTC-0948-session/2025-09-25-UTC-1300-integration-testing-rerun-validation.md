## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Re-run comprehensive integration tests with fresh test components

**Requirements Traceability:** Automated workflow re-validation, fresh component testing, consistent behavior verification

**Re-testing Strategy:**
- **Clean Environment:** Remove previous test components for fresh testing
- **Fresh Component Creation:** Create new TestReleaseComponent for clean testing
- **Comprehensive Upgrade Testing:** Test minor, patch, and major upgrades
- **Significant Release Validation:** Verify detection logic works consistently
- **PDCA Discovery Testing:** Confirm search functionality operates correctly
- **Workflow Integration Verification:** Ensure seamless operation across all scenarios

## **🔧 DO**

**Comprehensive Integration Re-testing Execution**

**Step 1: Clean Test Environment**
```bash
rm -rf components/TestReleaseComponent
# Clean slate for fresh testing
```

**Step 2: Create Fresh Test Component**
```bash
cd components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8
./web4tscomponent create TestReleaseComponent 0.1.0.0 all
# Fresh component with full Web4 structure
```

**Step 3: Test Minor Upgrade (Significant Release)**
```bash
./web4tscomponent on TestReleaseComponent 0.1.0.0 upgrade nextMinor
# Should attempt release note linking for 0.2.0.0
```

**Step 4: Verify Minor Upgrade Linking Attempt**
```bash
ls -la components/TestReleaseComponent/*/release.note.pdca.md
# Check if linking was attempted
```

**Step 5: Test Patch Upgrade (Non-Significant)**
```bash
./web4tscomponent on TestReleaseComponent 0.2.0.0 upgrade nextBuild
# Should not attempt release note linking for 0.2.0.1
```

**Step 6: Verify Patch Upgrade No Linking**
```bash
ls -la components/TestReleaseComponent/0.2.0.1/release.note.pdca.md
# Confirm no linking for patch upgrade
```

**Step 7: Test Major Upgrade (Significant Release)**
```bash
./web4tscomponent on TestReleaseComponent 0.2.0.1 upgrade nextMajor
# Should attempt release note linking for 1.0.0.0
```

**Step 8: Verify Major Upgrade Linking Attempt**
```bash
ls -la components/TestReleaseComponent/1.0.0.0/release.note.pdca.md
# Check if major upgrade attempted linking
```

**Step 9: Verify Component Structure**
```bash
find components/TestReleaseComponent -name '*.md' -o -name '*.json'
# Confirm proper component structure creation
```
