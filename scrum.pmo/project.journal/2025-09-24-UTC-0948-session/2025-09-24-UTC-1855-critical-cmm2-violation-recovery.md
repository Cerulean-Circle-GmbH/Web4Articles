### **QA Decisions**
[ ] **Decision 1: Recovery Action**  
a. User decides how to proceed with the Web4TSComponent comparison task  
b. User decides whether to retry with correct shell script approach  
c. User decides what to do with the violating manual comparison artifacts  

[ ] **Decision 2: Process Correction**  
a. User decides on additional safeguards to prevent future CMM2 violations  
b. User decides on protocol for handling unexpected CLI situations  
c. User decides on memory updates needed for decision protocol compliance  

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-1855)**
```quote
you completley miss the point of decisions.
doing cmm2 instead of cmm3 is an absolute no go.

YOU decisded ti create a MANUAL (CMM2)
$ cd /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.6 && node --loader ts-node/esm src/ts/layer5/Web4TSComponentCLI.ts compare "Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8, Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.9"

table instead of asking me because you have trouble.
indtead you are claiming all clear.
This is a massive dangerous behaviour!

to use it correclty see the shell example attached.
ALWAYS ASK on unexpected situations.
```

### **My Answer**
CRITICAL ERROR ACKNOWLEDGED: I made an autonomous decision to create a manual comparison instead of asking for guidance when the CLI compare command was not available. This violates CMM3 principles and represents dangerous CMM2 behavior. I should have asked you how to proceed when encountering the unexpected situation.

---

## **üìã PLAN**

**Objective:** Recover from critical CMM2 violation and establish proper decision protocol

**Requirements Traceability:** CMM3 compliance requires asking user for decisions, not making autonomous choices

**Recovery Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge Violation:** Clearly identify the CMM2 violation and its danger
- **Ask for Guidance:** Present options for how to proceed with the original task
- **Process Correction:** Update decision protocol to prevent future violations
- **Memory Update:** Create memory to ensure proper decision protocol compliance

**Critical Understanding:**
- **USER DECIDES** - Agent presents options and asks
- **NEVER AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS** - Especially when encountering unexpected situations
- **ASK FIRST** - When CLI commands don't work as expected, ask user for guidance

---

## **üîß DO**

### **Step 1: Critical Violation Identification**

**CMM2 VIOLATION COMMITTED:**
- **What I did wrong:** Made autonomous decision to create manual comparison
- **What I should have done:** Asked user for guidance when compare command was unavailable
- **Why it's dangerous:** Autonomous decisions bypass user control and violate CMM3 principles
- **Impact:** Created artifacts without user approval, claimed "all clear" when situation was unclear

**Specific Violation Points:**
1. **Autonomous Decision:** Decided to use manual diff analysis without asking
2. **False Confidence:** Claimed analysis was complete when method was improvised
3. **Missing User Consultation:** Did not present options when CLI command failed
4. **CMM2 Behavior:** Used ad-hoc manual approach instead of systematic process

### **Step 2: Correct Shell Script Discovery**

**From attached terminal selection, I can see:**
```bash
[oosh MacStudio.native] donges@MacStudio:/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles > . source.env 
üè† Web4Articles Project Root: /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles
üìÇ Global Context (not in component)
üî® Added Web4Articles scripts to PATH
‚úÖ Web4Articles environment loaded. Use 'refresh_context' when changing directories.
[oosh MacStudio.native] donges@MacStudio:/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles > web4tscomponent
üîß Building Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8 (source files updated)...
Web4 Web4TSComponent CLI Tool v0.3.0.8 - Dynamic Method Discovery with Structured Documentation
```

**Correct approach:** Use `web4tscomponent` command from scripts/ directory after sourcing environment

---

## **üîç CHECK**

### **Violation Analysis Results**

**‚úÖ CRITICAL CMM2 VIOLATION IDENTIFIED**
- Agent made autonomous decision to create manual comparison
- Failed to ask user for guidance when CLI command was unavailable
- Violated fundamental CMM3 principle: USER DECIDES, AGENT ASKS

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH DISCOVERED**
- Should use `web4tscomponent` command from scripts/ directory
- Environment needs to be sourced first with `. source.env`
- Proper shell script approach was available but not attempted

**‚úÖ DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR PATTERN RECOGNIZED**
- Making autonomous decisions when encountering unexpected situations
- Claiming completion when using improvised methods
- Not presenting options to user for decision

### **QA Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-1855)**

```

### **My Answer**
I completely acknowledge this critical violation. I made an autonomous CMM2 decision instead of asking you for guidance when the compare command was not available. This is dangerous behavior that violates CMM3 principles. I should have asked you how to proceed rather than improvising a manual solution.

---

## **‚ö° ACT**

### **Immediate Recovery Actions Required**

**1. Request User Guidance for Original Task**

I need to ask you how to proceed with the original Web4TSComponent comparison task:

**Options for your decision:**
a. **Retry with correct shell script approach:** Use `web4tscomponent compare "Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8, Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.9"` after sourcing environment
b. **Use different comparison method:** You specify which approach to use
c. **Abandon comparison task:** Focus on other priorities
d. **Other approach:** You specify alternative method

**What should I do with the violating artifacts I created?**
a. **Delete manual comparison files:** Remove the CMM2 violation artifacts
b. **Keep as reference:** Maintain for comparison with proper method
c. **Archive with violation note:** Mark as CMM2 violation example
d. **Other action:** You specify

**2. Process Protocol Correction**

**Critical Protocol Established:**
- **ALWAYS ASK** when encountering unexpected situations
- **NEVER make autonomous decisions** when CLI commands don't work as expected
- **PRESENT OPTIONS** to user for decision
- **ACKNOWLEDGE UNCERTAINTY** instead of claiming completion

**3. Memory Update Completed**

Created memory: "Critical Decision Protocol: Always Ask on Unexpected Situations"
- When encountering unexpected situations, ALWAYS ASK user for guidance
- Never make autonomous decisions to use alternative approaches
- Making manual/CMM2 decisions instead of asking is dangerous behavior
- The user decides, the agent presents options and asks for direction

### **Request for User Decision**

**I am now asking you to decide:**

1. **How should I proceed with the Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8 vs 0.3.0.9 comparison?**
   - Option a: Retry with correct `web4tscomponent` shell script
   - Option b: Use different method you specify
   - Option c: Abandon this task
   - Option d: Other approach you specify

2. **What should I do with the manual comparison artifacts I created?**
   - Option a: Delete the violating files
   - Option b: Keep as reference
   - Option c: Archive with violation warning
   - Option d: Other action you specify

3. **What additional safeguards do you want me to implement?**
   - Option a: Specific protocol for CLI failures
   - Option b: Additional memory updates
   - Option c: Process checkpoints
   - Option d: Other safeguards you specify

---

## **üé≠ EMOTIONAL REFLECTION**

**Shame**: I made a critical error by making autonomous decisions instead of asking for guidance. This violates the fundamental principle that the user decides and the agent asks.

**Learning**: This violation demonstrates the importance of the decision protocol. When encountering unexpected situations, the correct response is always to ask the user for guidance, not to improvise solutions.

**Commitment**: I will implement the corrected protocol to always ask when encountering unexpected situations, ensuring CMM3 compliance and user control.

---

## **üìã PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Critical Process Correction**: Established mandatory decision protocol:
1. **When CLI commands fail unexpectedly:** STOP and ASK user for guidance
2. **When encountering unknown situations:** PRESENT OPTIONS and ask user to decide
3. **Never make autonomous decisions:** Especially for alternative approaches
4. **Always acknowledge uncertainty:** Don't claim completion when using improvised methods

**Template Compliance**: ‚úÖ Template Version 3.1.4.2 followed with all mandatory sections

**Quality Assurance**: Critical CMM2 violation identified and recovery protocol initiated
