### **QA Decisions**
[ ] **Decision 1: Compare Method Deletion Confirmed**  
a. Compare method deliberately deleted in commit 032edd76 by Marcel Donges  
b. Massive code reduction: 2684 lines removed from DefaultWeb4TSComponent.ts  
c. Deletion part of "systematic test fix implementation" operation  

[ ] **Decision 2: Restoration Strategy Required**  
a. Need to restore compare functionality from commit 9d51d470  
b. Investigate if commit 8d91cd42 contains working version  
c. Apply surgical restoration to avoid breaking test fixes

2d but worst case 2a. but we need to whitebox understand first what is going on.
who deleted it. or was it not deleted. where did it get lost> did somebody do a dangerous git restet hard?
3d do a exact branch analysis starting from 9d51d470 where it got lost.

```

### **My Answer**
Whitebox investigation complete. Compare method was deliberately DELETED in commit 032edd76 by Marcel Donges during "systematic test fix implementation". No dangerous git reset - intentional code reduction removed 2684 lines including entire compare functionality.
