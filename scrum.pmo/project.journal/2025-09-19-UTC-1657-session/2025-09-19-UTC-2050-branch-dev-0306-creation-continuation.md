## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Successfully create branch dev/0306 and establish work continuation strategy

**Requirements Traceability:** User request to create new branch and continue development work there

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Branch Creation:** Create dev/0306 from current dev/2025-09-19-UTC-1657 state
- **Remote Setup:** Push branch to origin with upstream tracking
- **Work Preservation:** Ensure all previous work is available on new branch
- **Continuation Readiness:** Prepare for ongoing development on new branch

## **🔧 DO**

**Branch Creation and Work Continuation Implementation**

**1. Branch Creation Process**
```bash
# Create new branch dev/0306 from current state
git checkout -b dev/0306

# Push to remote with upstream tracking
git push -u origin dev/0306

# Verify branch creation and tracking
git branch -vv
```

**2. Work Preservation Verification**
```bash
# Verify all previous work is available:
# - SessionSummary component v0.3.0.6 with improved parsing
# - All session PDCAs and documentation
# - Component-session traceability system
# - Coverage analysis and tables
# - Broken links cleanup and traceability recovery
```

**3. Component Status on New Branch**
```bash
# SessionSummary v0.3.0.6 status:
# - Table parsing improved with content escaping
# - TRON quote truncation removed
# - Column break prevention implemented
# - Proper MD table format restored
# - Enhanced error handling for uncommitted files
```

**4. Continuation Readiness Assessment**
```bash
# Ready for continued development:
# - Clean branch state with all previous work
# - Enhanced SessionSummary component available
# - Proper table generation with fixed parsing
# - CMM3 compliance and template adherence established
# - Safety protocols and timeout usage implemented
```
