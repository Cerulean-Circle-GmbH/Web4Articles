### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **PDCA Compliance:** Re-read howto.PDCA.md as required by compliance protocol
- [x] **Architecture Strategy:** Simple IOR with no environment knowledge, ONCE handles context
- [ ] **IOR Simplification Approach:**
  - a) Create minimal IOR with only uuid, component, version properties
  - b) Include location and endpoint as optional for network capability
- [ ] **Build System Strategy:**
  - a) Create completely dependency-free Build 0.3.0.3 that bootstraps itself
  - b) Enhance existing Build 0.3.0.2 to be dependency-free
- [ ] **ONCE Integration Strategy:**
  - a) Modify ONCE 0.3.0.2 to use simple IOR 0.3.0.3 and create environment-aware instances
  - b) Keep ONCE 0.3.0.2 as-is and create adapter layer
- [ ] **Deinstall Restoration:**
  - a) Restore full once deinstall functionality with Web4 compliance
  - b) Implement minimal deinstall with basic cleaning

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1040)**
```quote
ok. now create a ior version 0.3.0.3 that is simple, fundamental and dependency free. ior does not know anything about its environmen. once is responsible to use the fundamental ior and create iors that make sense in the environment. modify once 0.3.0.2 to use the simple ior component and resolve the cyclic dependency this way.

then analyze from the pdcas what we wanted to achieve with the build system and create a dependency free build component 0.3.0.3 that can build once when using the once shell script. resto the once deinstall but stay full web4 compliant!!!
ask if you are not clear!
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Following PDCA compliance: re-read howto.PDCA.md as required. Creating simple, fundamental IOR 0.3.0.3 with no environment knowledge - ONCE handles environment context. Analyzing build system goals from PDCAs: seamless execution, dependency resolution, comprehensive build chain. Creating dependency-free Build 0.3.0.3. Restoring once deinstall with Web4 compliance. Created requirement e7f4a9d6-8c3b-4e2f-9a7d-6f8e3d5c9a7e.

**Learning Applied:** Simple fundamental components enable dependency-free architecture - IOR handles identification, ONCE handles environment.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create simple IOR 0.3.0.3 and dependency-free Build 0.3.0.3 to resolve circular dependencies and restore seamless ONCE execution

**Requirements Traceability:** e7f4a9d6-8c3b-4e2f-9a7d-6f8e3d5c9a7e

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Simple IOR 0.3.0.3:** Fundamental object identification without environment knowledge
- **ONCE Modification:** Use simple IOR to create environment-aware instances
- **Build System 0.3.0.3:** Dependency-free component that can build ONCE seamlessly
- **Deinstall Restoration:** Web4-compliant cleaning functionality

**Build System Goals from PDCAs:**
- **Seamless Execution:** "typing once should seamlessly execute the build chain"
- **Dependency Resolution:** Automatic component dependency building
- **Comprehensive Build Chain:** Replace manual component-by-component building
- **Clean Build Support:** npm run clean for reset capability

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Dependency-Free Architecture Implementation**

**1. Simple IOR 0.3.0.3 Design**
```typescript
// Fundamental IOR - no environment knowledge
interface IOR {
  uuid: string;      // Object identification
  component: string; // Component type
  version: string;   // Version
  location?: string; // Optional network location
  endpoint?: string; // Optional endpoint
}

// No imports from ONCE, User, or other components
// Pure identification interface
```

**2. ONCE 0.3.0.2 Integration Strategy**
```typescript
// ONCE creates environment-aware IORs using fundamental IOR
import { IOR } from '../../../../IOR/0.3.0.3/src/ts/layer3/IOR.interface.js';

// ONCE adds environment context to fundamental IORs
class EnvironmentAwareIOR extends IOR {
  // Environment-specific extensions
}
```

**3. Build System 0.3.0.3 Requirements**
```typescript
// From PDCA analysis - build system goals:
- Seamless once shell script execution
- Dependency-free bootstrap capability
- Comprehensive build chain orchestration
- Clean build support (npm run clean)
- Component dependency resolution
```

**4. Circular Dependency Resolution**
```
Current Problem: IOR ↔ ONCE circular dependency
Solution: IOR 0.3.0.3 (no ONCE knowledge) ← ONCE 0.3.0.2 (uses IOR)
Result: One-way dependency, no cycles
```
