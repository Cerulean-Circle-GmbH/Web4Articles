  - b) Use specific tested versions for consistency
- [ ] **Component Addition Strategy:**
  - a) Copy complete component directories to 0.3.0.2 versions
  - b) Selective file copying with version updates
- [ ] **Scripts Linking Strategy:**
  - a) Create scripts/versions links for all components with executable scripts
  - b) Create links only for primary CLI components

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-0950)**
```quote
add the latest state of all the other components into the branch as 0.3.02 versions especially requirement 0.1.2.2 as 0.3.02, user and unit
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Implementing complete ecosystem restoration by adding latest state of all supporting components as 0.3.0.2 versions. Adding Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2, User/0.1.3.0, Unit/0.1.3.0, Scenario/0.1.3.0, and Web4ChangeRequest/0.1.3.0 as 0.3.0.2 versions with scripts/versions linking. Created requirement b9d6f3a8-5c7e-4f2b-8a9d-6e4b7c2f8a9d.

**Learning Applied:** Complete ecosystem requires all supporting components in consistent versions for unified development environment.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Add all supporting components as 0.3.0.2 versions for complete ecosystem restoration

**Requirements Traceability:** b9d6f3a8-5c7e-4f2b-8a9d-6e4b7c2f8a9d

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Supporting Component Identification:** Found 5 components with latest versions
- **Version Mapping:** Copy latest versions to consistent 0.3.0.2 structure
- **Ecosystem Completion:** Unified development environment with consistent versions
- **Scripts Integration:** Create scripts/versions links for executable components

**Supporting Components to Add:**
```
Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2  -> Web4Requirement/0.3.0.2  (TRON specifically requested)
User/0.1.3.0             -> User/0.3.0.2             (TRON specifically requested)
Unit/0.1.3.0             -> Unit/0.3.0.2             (TRON specifically requested)
Scenario/0.1.3.0         -> Scenario/0.3.0.2         (Ecosystem support)
Web4ChangeRequest/0.1.3.0 -> Web4ChangeRequest/0.3.0.2 (Ecosystem support)
```

## **🔧 DO**

**Supporting Component Ecosystem Addition**

**1. Current State Analysis**
```bash
✅ Core Components (6): ONCE, Build, P2PServer, IOR, WsServer, HttpServer
✅ Version: 0.3.0.2 (restored from build-015)
❌ Supporting Components: Missing from 0.3.0.2 ecosystem
```

**2. Supporting Components Identified**
```bash
✅ Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2 - Latest requirement management component
✅ User/0.1.3.0 - Latest user management component  
✅ Unit/0.1.3.0 - Latest unit testing component
✅ Scenario/0.1.3.0 - Latest scenario management component
✅ Web4ChangeRequest/0.1.3.0 - Latest change request component
```

**3. Component Addition Process**
```bash
# For each supporting component:
# 1. Copy complete latest version directory to 0.3.0.2
# 2. Update version references if needed
# 3. Create scripts/versions links if executable scripts exist
```

**4. Expected Scripts/Versions Links**
```bash
scripts/versions/
├── requirement-v0.3.0.2 -> ../../components/Web4Requirement/0.3.0.2/requirement.sh
├── user-v0.3.0.2 -> ../../components/User/0.3.0.2/user.sh
├── unit-v0.3.0.2 -> ../../components/Unit/0.3.0.2/unit.sh
├── changerequest-v0.3.0.2 -> ../../components/Web4ChangeRequest/0.3.0.2/changerequest.sh
└── scenario-v0.3.0.2 -> ../../components/Scenario/0.3.0.2/scenario (if exists)
```
