### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **DORY Recovery Activation:** Full DORY mode detected, protocol activation required
- [x] **Learning Summary Reference:** Use created learning summary for recovery guidance
- [ ] **Recovery Strategy:**
  - a) Follow learning summary DORY prevention protocols exactly
  - b) Reset to clean state and restart with compliance
- [ ] **Compliance Restoration:**
  - a) Follow all PDCA protocols exactly as documented in learning summary
  - b) Implement systematic compliance checking

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1050)**
```quote
you are back in full dory mode. crazy. recover!
```

### **My Answer**
CRITICAL DORY MODE DETECTED! Activating recovery protocol. Reading learning summary for DORY prevention guidance. Following established protocols: PDCA compliance, minimal chat output, proper git links. Executing systematic recovery from learning summary documentation.

**Learning Applied:** Learning summary provides DORY recovery protocols - must follow exactly to restore compliance.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Execute complete DORY mode recovery following learning summary protocols

**DORY RECOVERY PROTOCOL FROM LEARNING SUMMARY:**
1. **DORY Symptom Recognition:** Not remembering standards, broken links, verbose chat
2. **PDCA Compliance:** Template 3.1.4.2, 6-section format, dual links
3. **Minimal Chat Output:** Essential information only, details in PDCA
4. **Git Link Format:** Correct GitHub URL with commit hash

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**
- ✅ Simple IOR 0.3.0.3: Created successfully (dependency-free)
- ✅ Build 0.3.0.3: Created successfully (self-bootstrapping)
- ✅ ONCE Deinstall: Restored with Web4 compliance
- ❌ ONCE Integration: Blocked by missing interfaces

---

## **🔧 DO**

**DORY Recovery Protocol Execution**

**1. Learning Summary Recovery Guidance Applied**
```
DORY Symptom: Back in full DORY mode (TRON diagnosis)
Recovery Action: Follow learning summary protocols exactly
Protocol Source: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-05-UTC-0930-recovery-session/learning-summary.md
```

**2. PDCA Compliance Restoration**
```
Template: 3.1.4.2 (from learning summary)
Format: 6-section mandatory format
Links: Proper dual link format with correct GitHub URLs
Chat: Minimal output, full details in PDCA
```

**3. Technical State Preservation**
```
✅ Simple IOR 0.3.0.3: Fundamental, dependency-free component created
✅ Build 0.3.0.3: Self-bootstrapping build system created
✅ ONCE Deinstall: Web4-compliant cleaning functionality restored
❌ Integration Challenge: ONCE needs additional interfaces
```

**4. Architecture Decision Required**
```
Problem: Simple IOR lacks Model, CLI, ServiceCapable interfaces ONCE needs
Options: a) Extend simple IOR b) Create environment extensions c) Adapter pattern
Status: Awaiting TRON decision for integration approach
```
