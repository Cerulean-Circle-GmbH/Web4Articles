  - b) Copy learning summary directly to sprint 20
- [ ] **Content Organization Strategy:**
  - a) Group learnings by category (Web4, ONCE, Components, etc.)
  - b) Chronological organization by session timeline

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1030)**
```quote
read all requirements again and create a learning-summar.md with dual links to the pdca or requirement.md similar to the one in sprint 20. then ln link it into sprint 20 with a utc timestamp in the name, for easy digestion when you are in dory mode.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Following PDCA compliance protocol: re-read howto.PDCA.md and CMMI understanding as required. Creating comprehensive learning-summary.md with dual links to all 70 requirements and PDCAs, following sprint 20 format. Will create UTC timestamped link in sprint 20 for DORY mode recovery access. Created requirement a9f6e3d8-7c4b-4e2f-9a6d-5f8c2e7a4d9f.

**Learning Applied:** Learning summary provides consolidated knowledge for team benefit and DORY mode recovery - essential for future sessions.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create comprehensive learning summary with all requirements analysis and sprint 20 integration

**Requirements Traceability:** a9f6e3d8-7c4b-4e2f-9a6d-5f8c2e7a4d9f

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Requirements Analysis:** Read all 70 scenario.json files in spec/requirements/
- **Learning Consolidation:** Extract key insights from requirements and PDCAs
- **Format Compliance:** Follow sprint 20 learnings.summary.md structure
- **Sprint 20 Integration:** Create UTC timestamped link for DORY recovery access

**Sprint 20 Format Structure:**
```markdown
# 📚 **Session - Learnings Summary**
## **🎯 Core Learnings**
### **1. Category Name**
- Learning point with dual link reference
- [Detailed PDCA](path/to/pdca.md)
```

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Learning Summary Creation with Requirements Analysis**

**1. Requirements Scope Analysis**
```bash
Total Requirements: 70 scenario.json files

Session Coverage: 2025-09-03 + 2025-09-05 sessions
```

**2. Sprint 20 Format Reference**
```markdown
Structure: Core Learnings → Categories → Learning points with dual links
Format: Category headers with numbered learning points
Links: Dual GitHub + local links to detailed PDCAs
Purpose: Consolidated knowledge for team benefit and future reference
```

**3. Learning Categories Identified**
```
- Web4 Architecture Principles (UCP, IOR, Scenario, Model)
- ONCE Component Development (Kernel, Capabilities, Service Integration)
- Version Management (Build tags, Component versions, Scripts linking)
- DORY Prevention (Symptom recognition, Compliance protocols)
- Recovery Strategies (Clean version selection, Ecosystem restoration)
```

**4. Requirements Analysis Process**
```bash
# Read all requirements and extract key learnings
for file in /workspace/spec/requirements/*.scenario.json; do
  # Extract learning points and categorize
  # Create dual links to requirements and related PDCAs
done
```

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Compliance Recognition and Learning Commitment**

### **Professional Accountability:**
**Deep Recognition** TRON correctly identified DORY symptom - not following 'pdca' prompt compliance protocol is a critical failure requiring immediate correction.

### **Learning Humility:**
**Focused Commitment** Understanding that 'pdca' prompt means immediate memory refresh and howto review, not just documentation request.

### **Knowledge Consolidation:**
**Systematic Dedication** Creating comprehensive learning summary ensures future sessions have access to consolidated wisdom and DORY recovery resources.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **PDCA Prompt Compliance:** 'pdca' = compliance check + memory refresh protocol
- ✅ **Learning Documentation:** Consolidated summaries prevent knowledge loss and support DORY recovery
- ✅ **Sprint Integration:** UTC timestamped links enable easy access during future sessions

**Quality Impact:** Learning summary with all requirements analysis provides comprehensive knowledge consolidation for team benefit and DORY mode recovery support

**Next PDCA Focus:** Execute learning summary creation with all requirements analysis and sprint 20 integration
