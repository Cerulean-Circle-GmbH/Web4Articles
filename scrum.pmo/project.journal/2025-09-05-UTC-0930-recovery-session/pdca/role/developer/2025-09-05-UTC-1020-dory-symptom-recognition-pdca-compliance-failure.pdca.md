### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **DORY Symptom Recognition:** First DORY symptom identified - not remembering decision/reporting format
- [x] **Compliance Protocol:** 'pdca' prompt requires immediate howto review and correction
- [x] **Memory Refresh:** Re-read howto.PDCA.md and CMMI understanding completed
- [ ] **Correction Strategy:**
  - a) Fix previous PDCA table with proper decision format and create correction notice
  - b) Acknowledge failure and continue with current understanding
- [ ] **Future Prevention:**
  - a) Always re-read howtos when prompted with 'pdca'
  - b) Implement systematic compliance checking

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-05-UTC-1020)**
```quote
no. now you learned what i wanted it and how bad you did it. not remembering howto do decisions and reporting is a first dory symptom. thats why „pdca" means to refresh your mind and reread the howtos, which you did not do. do it from now on and pdca!
```

### **My Answer**
CRITICAL DORY SYMPTOM RECOGNIZED! I failed to remember decision format and reporting standards. Did not follow 'pdca' prompt protocol to refresh mind and reread howtos. Re-read howto.PDCA.md and CMMI understanding now. 'pdca' prompt is compliance check requiring immediate memory refresh. Created requirement f8d4c7a9-5e3b-4f2d-8a6c-9f7e2d4c8a9f.

**Learning Applied:** 'pdca' prompt is compliance check and memory refresh protocol - must reread howtos immediately when prompted.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Implement proper PDCA compliance protocol after recognizing first DORY symptom

**Requirements Traceability:** f8d4c7a9-5e3b-4f2d-8a6c-9f7e2d4c8a9f

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **DORY Symptom Recognition:** Not remembering decision/reporting format is first warning sign
- **Compliance Protocol:** 'pdca' prompt requires immediate howto review and correction
- **Memory Refresh:** Re-read all key PDCA documents when prompted
- **Correction Implementation:** Fix previous PDCA if non-compliant

## **🔧 DO**

**PDCA Compliance Check Protocol Implementation**

**1. DORY Symptom Analysis**
```
❌ SYMPTOM: Not remembering how to do decisions and reporting
❌ TRIGGER: Table format failure despite clear requirements  
❌ ROOT CAUSE: Did not refresh memory with howto documents
✅ RECOGNITION: First DORY symptom identified
```

**2. Compliance Check Results**
```
Previous PDCA: 2025-09-05-UTC-1010-session-overview-table-comprehensive-analysis.pdca.md
Compliance Status: ❌ NON-COMPLIANT (Table format violations)
Issues Found: 
- Decision format not matching build-001 template exactly
- Reconstructed decisions instead of using original PDCA decision structures
- Did not follow 'pdca' prompt protocol to reread howtos
```

**3. Actions Taken**
```
✅ Re-read howto.PDCA.md (lines 330-403) - PDCA prompt compliance protocol
✅ Re-read PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md - CMM3 compliance requirements
✅ Identified DORY symptom - not remembering standards
✅ Recognized 'pdca' prompt purpose - compliance check and memory refresh
```

**4. Howto Protocol Understanding**
```
'pdca' prompt means:
- Quality gate for long sessions
- Memory refresh after complex tasks  
- Compliance enforcement for standards
- Learning opportunity from mistakes
- CMM3 maturity maintenance
```

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**PDCA Compliance Check (❌ FAILED)**
```
Previous PDCA: Table format did not match build-001 exactly
Decision Format: Reconstructed instead of using original PDCA structures
Howto Compliance: Did not follow 'pdca' prompt protocol
CMM3 Compliance: Failed to maintain standards
```

**Memory Refresh Verification (✅ COMPLETED)**
```
✅ howto.PDCA.md: Re-read compliance check protocol (lines 330-403)
✅ CMMI Understanding: Re-read CMM3 requirements and maturity levels
✅ DORY Recognition: Identified symptom pattern and prevention
✅ Protocol Understanding: 'pdca' = compliance check + memory refresh
```

**Compliance Protocol Understanding Verified**
- ✅ **DORY Symptom:** Not remembering standards is first warning sign
- ✅ **PDCA Prompt:** Compliance check requiring immediate howto review
- ✅ **Memory Refresh:** Must reread key documents when prompted
- ✅ **Prevention Protocol:** Always follow 'pdca' prompt with howto review

**Future Compliance Integration Confirmed**
- ✅ **Immediate Action:** Re-read howtos when prompted with 'pdca'
- ✅ **Standards Maintenance:** Follow defined processes exactly
- ✅ **DORY Prevention:** Recognize symptoms early and correct immediately

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** DORY symptom recognized and PDCA compliance protocol understood

**Compliance Protocol Enhanced:**
- **DORY Recognition:** First symptom (forgetting standards) identified and corrected
- **Memory Refresh:** Howto documents re-read for proper protocol understanding
- **Prevention Strategy:** Always follow 'pdca' prompt with immediate howto review

**PDCA Standards Benefits:**
- **Quality Maintenance:** Compliance checks prevent standard degradation
- **Memory Support:** Regular refresh prevents forgetting during long sessions
- **CMM3 Compliance:** Defined process followed exactly without variation

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Immediate Compliance:** Always re-read howtos when prompted with 'pdca'
2. **Standard Maintenance:** Follow defined processes exactly without assumptions
3. **DORY Prevention:** Recognize symptoms early and implement corrections

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Humility and Learning from DORY Symptom**

### **Professional Accountability:**
**Deep Recognition** TRON correctly identified first DORY symptom - not remembering basic standards is a critical warning sign requiring immediate correction.

### **Learning Commitment:**
**Intense Focus** Understanding that 'pdca' prompt is compliance check and memory refresh protocol, not just documentation request.

### **Prevention Dedication:**
**Systematic Commitment** Will always re-read howtos when prompted with 'pdca' to prevent standard degradation and maintain CMM3 compliance.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **DORY Symptom Recognition:** Not remembering standards is first warning sign
- ✅ **PDCA Prompt Protocol:** 'pdca' = compliance check + memory refresh requirement
- ✅ **Memory Refresh Requirement:** Always re-read howtos when prompted

**Quality Impact:** DORY symptom recognition enables early correction before complete standard degradation, maintaining CMM3 compliance and preventing session failures

**Next PDCA Focus:** Maintain strict PDCA compliance and always follow 'pdca' prompt protocol with immediate howto review

**🎯 DORY symptom recognized and corrected - PDCA compliance protocol understood and implemented! ⚠️🔄✅**

**"Compliance requires constant vigilance and memory refresh when prompted."** 🔧📊
