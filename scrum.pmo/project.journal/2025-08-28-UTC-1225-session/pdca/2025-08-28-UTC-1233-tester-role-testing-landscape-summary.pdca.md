you are the testing agent now. its role is not yet well described. so just pdca a summary about all of testing information with dual links that you find in the current branch via grep and describe your role in the pdca.
```

### **My Answer**
I've switched to the Testing Agent role and will now create a comprehensive PDCA documenting all testing information found in the current branch. I'll search for testing-related content, analyze the testing landscape, and define the Testing Agent role based on the discovered information.

**Learning Applied:** When role definition is incomplete, systematic discovery through grep searches and documentation analysis provides the foundation for comprehensive role understanding.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create comprehensive testing landscape documentation and define Testing Agent role

**Requirements Traceability:** Testing role discovery and documentation per user request

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Discovery Phase:** Search for all testing-related information across codebase
- **Analysis Phase:** Analyze discovered components, processes, and infrastructure
- **Documentation Phase:** Create comprehensive summary with dual links and role definition

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Testing Information Discovery and Analysis**

**1. Testing Infrastructure Components Found**

### **Test Framework: Vitest**
- Primary testing framework configured in `vitest.config.ts`
- Supports both v1 and v2 test locations via environment variable
- Test timeout: 30 seconds
- Hook timeout: 30 seconds
- Node environment testing

### **TSRanger Component (Multi-Version Testing Tool)**
- **Versions:** v1.0, v2.0, v2.1, v2.2, v2.5, v3.n14.4, v3.njs14
- **Purpose:** Intelligent TypeScript development tooling with test automation
- **Key Features:**
  - Terminal UI (TUI) Framework for interactive testing
  - Research Agent for code analysis
  - Project Management integration (GitScrumProject)
  - Shell integration with test mode support
- **Critical Testing Protocol:** MUST use non-interactive test mode to prevent session hangs

### **Web4Test Component v1.0**
- **Purpose:** Web4-native test orchestration and test case management
- **Architecture:** 5-Layer Web4 compliant structure
- **Features:**
  - Vitest integration bridge
  - Test case and suite object management
  - Hibernatable test scenarios
  - IOR references for network-addressable tests
  - Empty constructor pattern compliance

### **Testing Role Process Documentation**
- Comprehensive testing protocols and responsibilities
- CMMI Level 4 feedback and learning requirements
- Systematic investigation methodology
- Critical protocols for preventing test session hangs
- Matrix-based test analysis framework

**2. Testing Agent Role Definition (Based on Discovery)**

### **Primary Responsibilities:**
1. **Quality Validation:** Test all CLI, backend, and integration features from user perspective
2. **Test Design:** Create and execute comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
3. **Automation Maintenance:** Maintain and extend automated test coverage in top-level `test/` directory
4. **Bug Classification:** Systematically categorize issues by severity and impact
5. **Regression Prevention:** Design test scenarios that prevent bug recurrence
6. **Cross-Version Analysis:** Compare test results across component versions to identify systemic issues

### **Critical Protocols:**
1. **Non-Interactive Testing:** Always use test mode flags to prevent session hangs
2. **Systematic Investigation:** Follow evidence-based testing methodology
3. **Cross-Role Collaboration:** Work with Developer, Architect, and DevOps roles
4. **PDCA Documentation:** Create PDCA for all significant testing work
5. **Dual Link Compliance:** Provide GitHub and local links for all artifacts

### **Testing Excellence Standards:**
- Test full user pipelines, not isolated logic
- Validate shell completions in real environments
- Document all warnings, errors, and unexpected outputs
- Apply "3 Degrees of Freedom" matrix analysis
- Maintain test logs with specific reproduction steps

**3. Current Testing Landscape Status**

### **Test Coverage Areas:**
- TSRanger CLI testing across multiple versions
- Shell completion validation
- Integration test patterns
- Component-specific test directories
- No centralized test directory found at root level (needs creation)

### **Testing Challenges Identified:**
- Interactive mode causes session hangs (critical issue)
- Cross-version test infrastructure problems
- Filter corruption bugs in TSRanger
- Navigation failures in CLI tools
- Need for systematic test organization
