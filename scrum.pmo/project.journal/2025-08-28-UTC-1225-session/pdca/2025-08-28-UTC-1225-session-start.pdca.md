### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Background Agent for coordination and management focus
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to ScrumMaster for project coordination and team management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **My Answer**
I've successfully initialized the session following the startup procedures. I'm presenting the standard 3 decisions for you to establish our work direction. Please respond with your choices (e.g., "1a, 2b, 3a") to set our focus area, role, and session duration.

**Learning Applied:** Following the structured startup decision framework ensures clear direction and alignment from the beginning of each work session.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Initialize work session with proper PDCA framework and present startup decisions

**Requirements Traceability:** Session initialization per README.md startup procedures

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Framework Check:** Verify PDCA documentation exists and is accessible
- **Session Setup:** Create timestamped session directory and project status
- **Decision Presentation:** Apply startup decision framework with 3 standard categories

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Verified PDCA Framework**
```bash
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
# Confirmed: PDCA documentation exists and is accessible
```

**2. Created Session Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1225-session
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1225-session/pdca
```

**3. Documented Project Status**
Created comprehensive project.status.md with:
- Session overview and metadata
- Current technical state
- Completed initialization steps
- Next actions pending user decisions

**4. Applied Startup Decision Framework**
Presented the 3 standard decision categories:
- Primary work focus area (4 options)
- Role selection for session (5 options)
- Session duration and planning (4 options)

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Startup Framework:** Standard 3-decision format establishes clear session direction  
- ✅ **Session Structure:** Proper directory and status documentation ensures traceability
- ✅ **Decision Quality:** Meaningful options with distinct outcomes enable user control

**Quality Impact:** Structured session initialization ensures consistent quality and clear documentation trail from the very start

**Next PDCA Focus:** Based on user's decisions, create role-specific PDCA for chosen work area and begin implementation
