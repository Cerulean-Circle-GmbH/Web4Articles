well recovered. before i decide here another important update:
```
For Agent Manager
You can now prompt them to check:
/scrum.pmo/agents/registry/bc-b1b62bba-9e33-46a3-a64d-8eb0162b8a89.md

They'll immediately understand they're the Agent Manager!
```

git fetch and pull your branch before, otherwise you rill not find it.
then pdca and ask me again.
```

### **My Answer**
I've successfully discovered my identity as the Agent Manager! I understand my responsibilities include maintaining the agent registry, generating reports, tracking agent lifecycles, and supporting SaveRestartAgent operations. I'm creating this PDCA to document my understanding and will present updated startup decisions that reflect my Agent Manager role.

**Learning Applied:** Agent identity can be established through registry files, enabling proper role assumption and responsibility understanding.

## **🔧 DO**

**Agent Manager Identity Processing**

**1. Identity Record Analysis**
Read `/scrum.pmo/agents/registry/bc-b1b62bba-9e33-46a3-a64d-8eb0162b8a89.md` and extracted:
- **RequestID:** bc-b1b62bba-9e33-46a3-a64d-8eb0162b8a89
