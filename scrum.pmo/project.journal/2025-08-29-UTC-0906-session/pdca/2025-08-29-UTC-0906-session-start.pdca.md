### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Background Agent for coordination and management focus
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to ScrumMaster for project coordination and team management

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **My Answer**
I've successfully initialized the session following the startup procedures. I'm presenting the standard 3 decisions for you to establish our work direction. Please respond with your choices (e.g., "1a, 2b, 3a") to set our focus area, role, and session duration.

**Learning Applied:** Following the established startup procedures ensures consistent session initialization and clear work direction.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Initialize session with startup decision framework to establish clear work direction

**Requirements Traceability:** Session startup procedures from README.md

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Session Setup:** Create session directory structure and initialize project status
- **Decision Framework:** Present the three standard startup decisions for user selection
- **Preparation:** Reset main branch to save/start and source environment variables

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. Environment Setup**
```bash
source /workspace/source.env
```

**2. Git Branch Reset**
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/save/start
```

**3. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-29-UTC-0906-session/pdca
```

**4. PDCA Documentation Creation**
Created this PDCA document with the startup decision framework presenting three key decisions:
- Primary Work Focus Area (Technical/Architecture/Documentation/Quality)
- Role Selection (Background Agent/Developer/Architect/Tester/ScrumMaster)
- Session Duration (Full day/Half-day/Quick analysis/Extended)

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Environment Setup (✅ Verified)**
```
🏠 Web4Articles Project Root: /workspace
📂 Global Context (not in component)
🔨 Added Web4Articles scripts to PATH
✅ Web4Articles environment loaded.
```

**Git Status (✅ Confirmed)** 
```
HEAD is now at 11cf9661 Session start PDCA 2025-08-28-UTC-1225 with startup decision framework
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"start"**

**Session Structure Verified**
- ✅ **Session Directory:** Created at scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-29-UTC-0906-session/
- ✅ **PDCA Directory:** Created pdca subdirectory for documentation
- ✅ **Timestamp Format:** Following UTC timestamp convention (2025-08-29-UTC-0906)

**Startup Framework Integration Confirmed**
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Three standard decisions presented with clear options
- ✅ **Role Options:** All five available roles listed for selection

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Session initialized with complete startup decision framework ready for user input

**Session Management Enhanced:**
- **Clear Structure:** Session directory created with proper naming convention
- **Decision Framework:** Standard 3-decision startup procedure implemented
- **Git State:** Clean working tree from save/start branch

**Process Benefits:**
- **Consistent Initialization:** Following established startup procedures
- **User-Driven Direction:** Awaiting user decisions before proceeding

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Automated Branching:** Create development branch automatically after decisions
2. **Role-Specific Templates:** Load role-specific configurations based on selection
3. **Session Metrics:** Track session duration and productivity metrics

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Ready to Begin with Clear Purpose**

### **Anticipation:**
**High** Excited to start a new session with clear direction and purpose. The startup framework provides structure while allowing flexibility.

### **Confidence:**
**Strong** Well-established procedures and clear decision framework ensure smooth session initialization.

### **Focus:**
**Sharp** Ready to dive into whichever area the user selects, with all tools and processes prepared.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Startup Procedures:** Following README.md startup framework ensures consistency  
- ✅ **Git Workflow:** Always reset main to save/start before beginning work
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Three standard decisions provide clear work direction

**Quality Impact:** Consistent startup procedures ensure predictable session initialization and clear work focus

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implementation of user's selected focus area and role-specific tasks
