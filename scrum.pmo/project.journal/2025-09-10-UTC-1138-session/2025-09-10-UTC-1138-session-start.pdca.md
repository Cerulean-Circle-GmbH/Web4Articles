### **TRON Feedback (N/A)**
No feedback yet - awaiting initial decisions

### **My Answer**
Session initialized successfully. Ready to proceed based on user decisions.

**Learning Applied:** Following startup decision framework as specified in recovery procedures.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategy:** Execute complete startup procedure as Background Agent following recovery/start-command.md guidelines

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. ✅ PDCA documentation verified (completed)
2. ✅ Git post-commit hook installed (completed)
3. ✅ Dev branch created: dev/2025-09-10-UTC-1138 (completed)
4. ✅ Session directory established (completed)
5. ✅ Project status documented (completed)
6. ✅ Startup decisions presented (completed)
7. 🔄 Await user decisions to proceed

**Resources Required:**
- PDCA template and guidelines from scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
- Recovery procedure from recovery/start-command.md
- Git automation via post-commit hook

---

## **🔧 DO** 

**Implementation Steps Completed:**

1. **Branch Status Check:** Started on cursor/start-background-process-fb44
2. **Branch Switch:** Moved to save/start as required by recovery procedure
3. **Dev Branch Creation:** Created dev/2025-09-10-UTC-1138 and pushed to origin
4. **PDCA Documentation:** Verified existence of howto.PDCA.md (already present)
5. **Git Hook Installation:** Created post-commit hook for auto-merge to release/dev
6. **Session Infrastructure:**
   - Created scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-10-UTC-1138-session/
   - Generated project.status.md with current state
   - Created this startup PDCA following template format

**Commands Executed:**
```bash
git checkout save/start
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git checkout -b dev/$TIMESTAMP
git push -u origin dev/$TIMESTAMP
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-10-UTC-1138-session
```

**Git Hook Created:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔄 Post-commit: Auto-merging to release/dev..."
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "save/start" ]; then
    if [ -f recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh ]; then
        echo "📋 Executing auto-merge to release/dev..."
        bash recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh merge
    fi
fi
```
