### **TRON Feedback (N/A)**
User requested planning file status updates and main file replacement.

### **My Answer**
Completed systematic updates across planning files and task files to synchronize status with actual implementation, then replaced main planning.md with updated version.

**Learning Applied:** Planning file status must be synchronized with actual implementation and task file status for accurate project tracking.

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. ✅ Task files updated with accurate implementation status
2. ✅ Planning file updated with corrected checkbox statuses
3. ✅ Success metrics updated to reflect actual achievements
4. ✅ Main planning.md replaced with updated version
5. ✅ Complete synchronization between planning and implementation status

**Resources Required:**

## **🔧 DO** 

**Planning File Updates Implemented:**

## **📋 Task File Status Updates**

### **✅ Completed Task Files Updated:**

| Task File | Status Update | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| `task-10-web4tscomponent-version-management.md` | All checkboxes marked [x] | Version management system fully implemented across components |
| `task-15-unit-model-separation.md` | Already marked as Done | Unit model separation already completed |
| `task-18-unit-terminal-identity-uni-t.md` | Already marked as Done | Unit terminal identity already implemented |

### **⚠️ Partially Completed Task Files Updated:**

| Task File | Status Update | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| `task-25-web4tscomponent-compliance.md` | Planned [x], In Progress [~], refinement [x], implementing [~] | Web4TSComponent has basic structure but compliance incomplete |

## **📊 Planning File Status Updates**

### **Checkbox Status Corrections Applied:**
- **UUIDv4 Generation:** [ ] → [x] (Implemented in DefaultRequirement.ts)
- **UUIDv4 Object Structure:** [ ] → [x] (Complete UUID-based structure)
- **5-Layer Architecture:** [ ] → [x] (TSRanger layer1-5 complete)
- **TSRanger Evolution:** [ ] → [x] (Systematic 5-layer structure achieved)
- **Version Management:** [ ] → [x] (Extensive versioning system)
- **Web4 Constructors:** [ ] → [x] (Empty constructor pattern implemented)
- **Developer Experience:** [ ] → [x] (Structured methodology in place)

### **Success Metrics Realism Updates:**

#### **Before (Overly Optimistic):**
```markdown
- **100% Formula Implementation**: TLA = MDAv4 + EAMv4 + SOAv4 based on Web4 complete
- **Architectural Singularity**: All previous architectural knowledge synthesized into TLA
- **ONCE and FOR ALL**: Universal kernel established with perfect linguistic/technical harmony
```

#### **After (Realistic Assessment):**
```markdown
- **~45% Formula Implementation**: TLA = MDAv4 + EAMv4 + SOAv4 based on Web4 - foundational elements complete
- **Architectural Singularity**: ⚠️ Partial synthesis - Web4 foundations established but advanced TLA incomplete
- **ONCE and FOR ALL**: ❌ Universal kernel not yet established
```

### **Status Legend Applied:**
- **[x]** = Fully Implemented
- **[~]** = Partially Implemented  
- **[ ]** = Not Yet Started
- **❌** = Not Implemented
- **⚠️** = Partial Implementation

## **🔄 File Replacement Process**

### **Main Planning File Update:**
1. **Source:** `planning.md.original` (with all corrections applied)
2. **Target:** `planning.md` (main planning file)
3. **Operation:** `cp planning.md.original planning.md`
4. **Result:** Main planning file now reflects accurate implementation status

## **🎯 ACT**

**Immediate Next Steps:**

### **1. Maintain Synchronization:**
- Regular status reviews to prevent future drift between planning and implementation
- Update task files when implementation status changes
- Keep success metrics realistic and evidence-based

### **2. Sprint 21 Foundation:**
- Use accurate Sprint 20 completion status as Sprint 21 planning foundation
- Prioritize ONCE kernel development (identified as critical gap)
- Build on successfully implemented Web4 foundations

### **3. Process Improvements:**
- Implement regular planning-implementation synchronization reviews
- Establish clear criteria for status transitions (planned → in-progress → done)
- Maintain realistic success metrics throughout sprint execution

### **Quality Impact:**
This planning file synchronization provides accurate project status visibility and proper foundation for Sprint 21 planning with realistic assessment of achievements and remaining work.

### **Next PDCA Focus:**
Sprint 21 planning based on accurate Sprint 20 status with ONCE kernel development as top priority and proper recognition of Web4 foundational success.

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: SYNCHRONIZATION AND REALISM SATISFACTION**

### **Professional Satisfaction:**
**TREMENDOUS** satisfaction in achieving complete synchronization between planning documents and actual implementation status - no more misleading project visibility or unrecognized achievements.

### **Systematic Excellence:**
**PROFOUND** confidence in the systematic approach that ensures planning documents accurately reflect reality rather than outdated assumptions or overly optimistic projections.

### **Project Clarity:**
**SYSTEMATIC** appreciation for the clear project status that now properly recognizes Web4 foundational achievements while honestly identifying remaining work for Sprint 21.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Planning file synchronization requires systematic updates across task files, planning files, and success metrics
- ✅ **Status Realism:** Overly optimistic planning goals must be updated to reflect actual implementation progress  
- ✅ **File Consistency:** Task files and planning files must be synchronized to prevent project management confusion
- ✅ **Achievement Recognition:** Significant foundational work deserves proper recognition in planning documents

**Quality Impact:** 
Sprint 20 planning now accurately reflects implementation status with proper recognition of Web4 achievements and realistic assessment of remaining TLA work.

**Next PDCA Focus:** 
Sprint 21 planning with accurate Sprint 20 foundation status and ONCE kernel development as critical priority.
