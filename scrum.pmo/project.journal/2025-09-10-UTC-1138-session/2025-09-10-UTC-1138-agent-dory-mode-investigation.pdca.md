  - c) Keep branches separate until agent work is validated and corrected
  - d) Create integration plan after complete analysis of agent violations

- [ ] **Decision 2: DORY Mode Prevention**
  - a) Create systematic DORY mode detection and prevention protocols
  - b) Implement agent session handover documentation requirements
  - c) Establish architectural violation detection system
  - d) Focus on learning from agent mistakes for process improvement

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-10-UTC-1138)**
```quote
there is an agent, that built most of the unit, but it entered full dory mode and terminal failure. check if it added latest changes to your branch, or to dev/req0305
pdca about the findings
```

### **My Answer**
Investigated agent work and found dev/req0305 branch with significant unit development but clear DORY mode violations. Agent built substantial components but introduced switch cases violating DefaultCLI dynamic discovery principles and experienced unit system bugs with EEXIST errors.

**Learning Applied:** Agent investigation reveals both valuable technical work and critical architectural violations requiring systematic analysis and selective integration.
