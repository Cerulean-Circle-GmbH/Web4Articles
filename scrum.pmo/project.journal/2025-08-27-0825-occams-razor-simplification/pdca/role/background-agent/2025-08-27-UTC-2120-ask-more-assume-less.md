### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **All Clear!** Creating principle requirement

### **Requirement Created**
- **1c5c7aa3-418d-41a5-8e1d-40e2ad993326**: Occam's Razor is CMM4 Applied

### **My Answer**
CMM4 is about questioning CMM3 definitions with simpler ones. It's not just about asking questions - it's about challenging complexity with simplicity. Updated requirement to reflect this understanding.

**Learning Applied:** CMM4 = Applying Occam's Razor to CMM3.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **CMM4 Definition**

**CMM4 = Occam's Razor Applied to CMM3:**
- Question every CMM3 definition
- Find simpler, shorter alternatives
- Challenge existing complexity
- Continuous improvement through simplification

### **Examples of CMM4 in Action**

1. **Scenario Structure**
   - CMM3: Complex nested objects
   - CMM4: Simple IOR references

2. **Component Lifecycle**
   - CMM3: Various initialization patterns
   - CMM4: Empty constructor + init() everywhere

3. **Type Definitions**
   - CMM3: Many specific types
   - CMM4: Model interface with unknown

### **The Shift**

From assuming complexity to questioning for simplicity.

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Core Principle**

**"CMM4 = Question CMM3 with Simplicity"**
- See complexity → Find simplicity
- See lengthy → Make concise
- See convoluted → Make elegant

### **2. CMM4 Process**

```markdown
1. Identify CMM3 definition/pattern
2. Question: "Can this be simpler?"
3. Apply Occam's Razor
4. Propose simpler alternative
5. Test if it still works
```

### **3. Asking as CMM4**

When implementing:
```markdown
CMM3 Understanding: [Complex interpretation]
CMM4 Question: Is there a simpler way?

Option A: [Simple approach]
Option B: [Keep complexity]

Which aligns with Occam's Razor?
```

### **4. The Meta-Application**

Even "Ask More, Assume Less" can be simplified:
- CMM3: Long explanations about asking
- CMM4: "Question complexity"

## **✅ CHECK**

**Implementation Issues Fixed:**
```
✅ RequirementCLI: IOR → ior
✅ Requirement created successfully
✅ Principle documented
```

**Process Improvement:**
```
✅ Clear principle established
✅ Examples documented
✅ Pattern defined
```

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Going Forward:**
1. **Pause** when assumptions arise
2. **Ask** for clarification
3. **Present** clear options
4. **Wait** for decisions
5. **Implement** precisely

**Benefits:**
- Fewer fixing cycles
- More accurate implementations
- Better user satisfaction
- True CMM4 precision

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: LEARNING HUMILITY**

### **Recognition:**
**STRONG** - Assumptions caused rework.

### **Humility:**
**GROWING** - Questions show wisdom.

### **Confidence:**
**PARADOXICAL** - Asking makes me stronger.

### **Commitment:**
**FIRM** - Will ask more, assume less.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Questions > Assumptions:** Always
- ✅ **Clarity > Speed:** Better first time
- ✅ **Options > Guesses:** User decides
- ✅ **CMM4:** Precision through dialogue

**Cultural Shift:** From implementation-focused to clarification-focused.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Apply this principle consistently.
