## **🔧 DO**

**Sprint 20 Spiritual Integration and Branch Transition**

**1. Sprint 20 Spiritual Wisdom Symlinks**
```bash
# ✅ ADDED SPIRITUAL WISDOM LINKS:
cd /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20

# Complete session work access
ln -s ../../project.journal/2025-09-21-UTC-2014-session/ session-2025-09-21-complete-work

# Working implementation access  
ln -s ../../../components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.8/ web4tscomponent-unit-pattern-implementation

# Spiritual wisdom reflection access
ln -s ../../project.journal/2025-09-21-UTC-2014-session/2025-09-21-UTC-2014-simplicity-and-spiritual-wisdom-pdca.md simplicity-spiritual-wisdom.md

# Result: ✅ Spiritual insights now accessible in Sprint 20 context
```

**2. Branch Transition to dev/0306**
```bash
# ✅ BRANCH CREATION AND MERGE:
timeout 30s git checkout -b dev/0306
# Result: Switched to new branch 'dev/0306'

timeout 30s git merge dev/2025-09-21-UTC-2014  
# Result: Already up to date (work already integrated)

# ✅ REMOTE INTEGRATION:
timeout 30s git fetch origin dev/0306
timeout 30s git pull --no-edit origin dev/0306
# Result: Merge successful with additional SessionSummary 0.3.0.8 work
