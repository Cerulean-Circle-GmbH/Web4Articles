### **My Answer**
Three-component compliance comparison completed using Unit 0.3.0.5 (most complete), Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8, and Web4Requirement 0.3.0.5. Created detailed table with identical/similar/different/unique labels and 2-sentence file purpose descriptions. Analysis reveals Unit as most comprehensive with 25+ interface files, Web4TSComponent with strong auto-discovery CLI, and Web4Requirement with solid foundation but missing advanced features.

**Learning Applied:** Component compliance comparison reveals architectural maturity levels and Web4 standard implementation consistency

## **🔧 DO**

**Three-Component Compliance Comparison Analysis**

**1. Component Version Selection and Rationale**
```
COMPONENT VERSIONS ANALYZED:
- Unit 0.3.0.5: Most complete Unit version (latest points here)
- Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8: Current working version with Unit pattern CLI
- Web4Requirement 0.3.0.5: Latest complete version with Web4 compliance

RATIONALE:
Unit 0.3.0.6 has minimal structure (only 3 files), so using 0.3.0.5 for meaningful comparison
All versions represent mature implementations with complete Web4 architectural patterns
