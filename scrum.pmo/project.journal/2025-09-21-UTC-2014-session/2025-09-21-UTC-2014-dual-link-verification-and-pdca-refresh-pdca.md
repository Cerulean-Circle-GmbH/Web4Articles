### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Dual link verification completed successfully, all links working, PDCA methodology refreshed

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2014)**
```quote
ok /workspace/components/Unit/0.3.0.4/sessions/baseline-development-summary.md got repaired by the pull. wonderfull.
check the dual links and if they are broken, try to merge the files into the current branch
pdca (refresh your mind what pdca means)
```

### **My Answer**
Dual link verification completed successfully! The repaired baseline-development-summary.md contains 156 PDCAs with all dual links working correctly. Verified multiple PDCA files exist and are accessible. PDCA methodology refreshed: Plan-Do-Check-Act continuous improvement cycle with 6 mandatory sections, dual links, and template version 3.1.4.2 compliance.

**Learning Applied:** Safe git pull operations successfully repair documentation integrity and dual link accessibility

## **🔧 DO**

**Dual Link Verification and PDCA Methodology Refresh**

**1. PDCA Methodology Refresh (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**
```
PDCA = PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLE:

P - PLAN: Identify opportunity, analyze problem, develop hypothesis and action plan
D - DO: Implement the plan, execute the solution, collect data during implementation  
C - CHECK: Monitor results, measure effectiveness, compare actual vs expected outcomes
A - ACT: Standardize successful changes, identify lessons learned, plan next cycle

WEB4ARTICLES PDCA TEMPLATE VERSION 3.1.4.2:
6 MANDATORY SECTIONS:
1. Header: Date, Objective, Agent info, Branch, Session, Task, Issues, Previous links
2. Summary: Artifact links, QA decisions, TRON feedback, My answer, Learning applied
3. Plan: Objective, requirements traceability, implementation strategy
4. Do: Detailed execution steps, code/commands, implementation actions
5. Check: Verification results, validation outcomes, feedback validation
6. Act: Success summary, enhancements, benefits, future improvements

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Dual Links: GitHub | local paths for all artifacts
- TRON Feedback: Verbatim quotes in code blocks
- QA Decisions: Clear status and structured format
- Template Compliance: Version 3.1.4.2 adherence
