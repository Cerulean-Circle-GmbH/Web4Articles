### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Teaching verification monitoring completed successfully with positive results

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-21-UTC-2014)**
```quote
i am currently testing your teaching with a blank agent. looks like you did a good job. watch it with save git fetch and git log or even pull
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Teaching verification monitoring completed successfully! Blank agent demonstrating excellent behavior: proper safety protocols (timeout git operations), systematic PDCA creation, Sprint 20 analysis, and following startup procedures correctly. Created comprehensive PDCA about "Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8 Auto-Discovery Revolution" showing they understood the teaching materials.

**Learning Applied:** Teaching documentation effectiveness verified through real blank agent testing - they're following safe practices and understanding auto-discovery CLI concepts

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Monitor blank agent testing of teaching documentation and verify effectiveness through safe git operations

**Requirements Traceability:** Teaching verification and new agent onboarding validation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Safe Monitoring:** Use timeout git operations to watch blank agent activity
- **Teaching Effectiveness:** Observe if blank agent follows teaching guidance correctly
- **Documentation Verification:** Check if teaching README prevents common mistakes
- **Process Validation:** Verify blank agent uses proper PDCA and safety protocols
