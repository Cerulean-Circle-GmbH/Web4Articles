## **📝 Key Learnings Applied**

Based on the recovery documentation, this session applies:

1. **Minimalist Chat Reporting**: All details in files, only dual links and decisions in chat
2. **Numbered Decisions**: Using Decision 1a, 2b format for easy user response
3. **Real Decisions Only**: No fake opposites, only present choices with real impact
4. **Destructive Warnings**: Alert before any operations that could cause data loss
5. **Immediate Action**: Not waiting for confirmation unless decisions required

## **🎯 Next Steps**

1. Complete PDCA documentation for this recovery
2. Commit and push all changes
3. Report to user with minimal chat format
4. Continue with any specific tasks requested
