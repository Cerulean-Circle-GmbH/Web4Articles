### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-24-UTC-1453)**
```quote
i talked about the bad commands and the haning mitigation. you seem not aware of it. research about it and create a memory.
research about howto format decisions and become cmm3 ... currently you are cmm2
```

### **My Answer**
Immediately researching bad commands/hanging mitigation and CMM3 decision formatting requirements. Found critical documentation about Unicode characters causing hangs, interactive command prevention, and proper CMM3 decision structure. Creating systematic memories for consistent application and CMM3 compliance advancement.

**Learning Applied:** Major knowledge gaps must be systematically researched and integrated as memories to prevent repeated compliance failures and advance CMM maturity level.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Research and systematically integrate critical knowledge about bad commands, hanging mitigation, and CMM3 decision formatting requirements

**Requirements Traceability:** CMM3 systematic process compliance and command safety protocol adherence

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Codebase Research:** Use systematic search to find documentation about bad commands and hanging mitigation
- **CMM Analysis:** Research CMM2 vs CMM3 differences and decision formatting requirements
- **Memory Integration:** Create and update memories with critical process knowledge
- **Compliance Assessment:** Understand current CMM2 behavior and requirements for CMM3 advancement

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Critical Knowledge Gap Research and Integration**

**1. Bad Commands and Hanging Mitigation Research**
```yaml
Key Documentation Found:
- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/bad.interactive.sh.commands.md
- scrum.pmo/process/testing-process-excellence.md
- Multiple incident reports documenting hanging issues

Critical Discoveries:
- Unicode characters (🧹✅📁📊) in terminal commands cause hanging scripts
- Interactive commands without proper flags cause indefinite hangs
- Complex compound commands with multiple && operators create encoding issues
- Background agents cannot handle interactive prompts - requires non-interactive alternatives

Bad Command Categories:
Git Operations:
- git pull origin branch → Use git pull --no-edit origin branch
- git cherry-pick → Use git cherry-pick --no-commit  
- git merge → Use git merge --ff-only or with conflict preparation
- git reset --hard → Destructive, use git revert instead

Package Managers:  
- npm install → Use npm install --yes
- apt-get install → Use apt-get install -y

TSRanger Testing:
- Direct tsranger commands → Use tsranger test '[command]' 
- Interactive mode → Use TSRANGER_TEST_MODE=1 environment variable
```

**2. CMM2 vs CMM3 Analysis**
```yaml
CMM2 (Current Level - Template Following):
- Characteristics: Templates create repeatability but with hallucination room
- Problem: Individual variations occur even following "same" process  
- Example: Recipe templates with room for baker interpretation
- Result: Statistical noise, subjective to actor/organization

CMM3 (Target Level - Defined Objective):
- Characteristics: Unit exists that defines process completely, objectively
- Method: Assembly line precision with no undefined states
- Foundation: Small automated well-tested first principles
- Result: Scientific reproducibility independent of context

CMM3 Requirements:
- No variations allowed anywhere in process execution
- System halts when undefined states encountered  
- Objective definitions eliminate subjective interpretation
- Identical structure and compliance across all applications
```

**3. CMM3 Decision Format Requirements Research**
```yaml
Decision Format Rules (from PDCA.howto.decide.md):
1. Only present REAL user decisions, not agent assumptions
2. Use simple format: "Decision 1: [Title]" with "a) option, b) option"  
3. Never create fake opposites or artificial options
4. No ridiculous numbering like "1. a)" format (merge conflict artifact)
5. Copy decisions exactly to chat responses
6. Present clear options with rationale when multiple approaches exist
7. Always ask user when encountering genuine ambiguity

Critical Principle: "The QA Decisions section is for USER decisions, not agent decisions!"

Bad Decision Examples:
- Creating artificial opposites where only one logical approach exists
- Using complex numbering schemes from merge conflicts
- Making assumptions about user preferences without asking
```

**4. Memory Integration Completed**
```yaml
Memory Updates Applied:
- Updated 6399561: Enhanced bad commands prevention with Unicode hanging details
- Created New: CMM2 vs CMM3 Understanding with systematic differences  
- Created New: CMM3 Decision Format Requirements with specific rules

Integration Result:
- Hanging prevention knowledge systematically captured
- CMM level progression requirements understood
- Decision formatting compliance requirements established
```
