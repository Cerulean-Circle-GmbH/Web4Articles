## Memory Entries

| Memory ID | Memory Content |
|-----------|----------------|
| 9284058 | Found comprehensive process.memory.fixed.md with 34 memory entries covering dual link formats (§ notation mandatory), test output requirements (all tests to /test/data), CMM levels 1-5 definitions, PDCA iterative patterns, and TRON verification principles. Document contains specific Memory IDs 9282142-9283925 with exact content for systematic memory management and cross-instance synchronization. Critical for maintaining process compliance and understanding project-specific requirements beyond standard approaches. |
| 7690588 | Chat responses must structure decisions as hierarchical lists with numbers and letters at the next level (e.g., 1. First decision, a. Sub-decision, b. Another sub-decision, 2. Second decision). Do not invent decisions that aren't from the user. Do not warn about extensive refactoring work, but DO warn about testing things that aren't even touched instead of being done. Keep chat responses simple with detailed tasks only in PDCA documents. |
| 7689399 | All ONCE CLI tools (once, once-v0.1.0.2, once-v0.2.0.0, etc.) require sourcing the environment file before use. Must run `source source.env` first to make the tools available in PATH. This is a prerequisite for any ONCE command testing or usage. |
| 7666404 | CRITICAL: Never start servers in foreground during testing sessions as they always cause hangs. Always use background execution with & for any server commands. Trust existing automated test architecture instead of attempting manual server conflict validation - the tests are comprehensive and handle all scenarios including existing servers gracefully. |
| 7665887 | The user wants Tootsie implemented as a Web4 TypeScript component and structured with a radical object-oriented programming style. |
| 7665194 | In the ONCE project, the ONCE CLI 'once demo' subcommand runs in interactive mode by default, causing the server to run in the foreground and hang; by contrast, the 'once test' command exits after each input sequence and cleans up all processes gracefully. |
| 7636834 | In the ONCE project, the ONCE CLI 'once demo' subcommand runs in interactive mode by default, causing the server to run in the foreground and hang; by contrast, the 'once test' command exits after each input sequence and cleans up all processes gracefully. |
| 7636231 | For the ONCE project, use 'web4tscomponent version next patch' when bumping the project's version. |
| 7636216 | The user prefers code to be organized as classes and follow Web4 architecture principles rather than standalone scripts. |
| 7625391 | The user prefers that the assistant stay in the same scrum.pmo/project.journal session directory and not create a new journal entry for every PDCA cycle, and to clean up extra journal entries from GitHub before proceeding. |
| 7625379 | In this project, if no IP address is found, use 'localhost' as a fallback. |
| 7625371 | The project's ONCE CLI usage/help is generated by TypeScript code rather than shell scripts. |
| 7625361 | For ONCE CLI usage output, color coding: cyan for the base command 'once'; white for the subcommand 'demo'; yellow for component placeholder (e.g., <key-wait-key-sequence>). |
| 7625356 | This project's CLI uses positional parameters in angle brackets instead of option flags (e.g., <headless> instead of --headless). |
| 7495251 | PDCAs must follow strict format: 1) Header with Date/Objective/Role/Issues, 2) Summary section with Artifact Links and QA Decisions (checkboxes), 3) Horizontal separators (---) between Plan/Do/Check/Act sections, 4) QA Feedback with verbatim quote and timestamp in Check section, 5) PDCA Process Update section, 6) Final one-line summary with emojis. Use checkboxes: [x] for completed, [ ] for pending decisions. Recovery process now automatically generates proper format with embedded reminders. Always use the newest PDCA template located at /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md with practical placeholders. |
| 7495247 | In this project, always reset the 'main' branch to the latest version of save/start and start all operations from main as a standard workflow convention. |
| 7263821 | The 'requirement' command requires sourcing /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/source.env before use. If encountering "bash: requirement: command not found", run: source /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/source.env |
| 7185652 | Chat responses should be short and diligent with dual links and decision only. All detailed implementation results, testing output, verification steps, and comprehensive documentation must be included in the PDCA document itself, not in chat responses. This ensures all technical details are properly documented and referenced while keeping chat responses focused and actionable. The requirement process-file feature (UUID: 11197f0f-c193-49af-98ee-d546595aed5c) was created for future batch processing of requirement documentation, enabling reliable extraction of patterns and automatic dual link updates. |
| 7174748 | The user prefers that after TRON feedback, the assistant adds a "My Answer" section and always starts with the PDCA sections in responses. |
| 7174744 | The project uses .ansi as the file extension for git branch log output files (git.<timestamp>.branch.log.ansi) instead of .ansi.txt so that .ansi is recognized by the cursor. |
| 7174740 | The project uses 'requirement' as a globally available shell command that should work correctly from any working directory via PATH. |
| 7174736 | External references should be stored in one central location at /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared and linked there via ln commands for easy discovery. |
| 7174733 | When moving or renaming files in this project, use git mv instead of copying to preserve Git history. |
| 6937788 | The user prefers the assistant not to use echo commands in the terminal, as they find them useless. |
| 6917913 | The user prefers using radical semantic versioning for the Unit component and wants version tags mentioned in the PDCA metadata next to the previous commit SHA, starting with "0.1.0.0-initial". |
| 6917891 | The user prefers that the assistant ask them for decisions and not decide everything on its own. |
| 6917876 | In PDCA prompt protocol, under the Artifact Links section always include double links (GitHub and local) for all changed files and for the newly created requirement. |
| 6902297 | The user requires git add, commit, and push operations after every PDCA creation to ensure proper version control and traceability. This practice maintains development history and enables rollback capabilities for business processes as per Web4 principles. |
| 6896504 | TSRanger CLI supports a debug mode invoked via 'tsranger debug' that shows [DEBUG] lines; default 'tsranger' invocation should not show debug lines. |
| 6896499 | The user prefers that chat responses be short, containing only dual-format artifact links and decisions; all substantive answers and any emotional feedback should be included in the PDCA section. |
| 6896493 | Coding convention: Never use non-empty constructors; always initialize objects from Scenario; always load Scenario from an IOR, including the IOR itself. |
| 6896476 | The user prefers that the assistant always answer using the PDCA format, providing only the PDCA link and the decisions in the chat. All substantive answers and any emotional feedback should be included in the PDCA document. Additionally, the assistant should ask the user to confirm any critical typos in file or folder names. |
| 6848913 | In this project, Vitest is used for testing; Jest is forbidden. |
| 6735094 | Bad tests are more expensive than no tests. TSRanger v2.2 testing revealed that false negative tests (reading shell prompts instead of application state) wasted 6+ hours chasing phantom bugs, created unnecessary code modifications, and undermined developer confidence. The test helper `getPromptLine()` was fundamentally wrong from the beginning, parsing shell environment contamination rather than actual TSRanger table output. Principle established: Only create unambiguous tests that read actual application behavior. Manual validation confirmed TSRanger v2.2 works perfectly - all functionality (filtering, navigation, tab advancement, backspace clearing) is fully operational. |
| 6715308 | TSRanger v2.2 filter typing works perfectly. Characters like 'f', 'g', 'te' are correctly captured and processed, and the filtering functionality works flawlessly. Previous reports of broken filtering were due to false negative test infrastructure that was reading shell prompts instead of TSRanger application state. Manual testing confirms all functionality works: filter typing, navigation, tab advancement, and backspace clearing all operate correctly. The issue was never in the application code but in test helpers parsing shell environment contamination. |
| 6713745 | Always use one-liner commit messages with git commit -m "..." to avoid hangs. Every PDCA must include in the header metadata: **📎 Previous Commit:** with SHA and description, and **🔗 Previous PDCA:** with dual GitHub|Local links to maintain traceability chain. This prevents breaking the PDCA continuity and ensures proper project documentation lineage. |
| 6713255 | The user prefers that the assistant always answer using the PDCA format, providing only the PDCA link and the decisions in the chat. All substantive answers and any emotional feedback should be included in the PDCA document. Additionally, the assistant should ask the user to confirm any critical typos in file or folder names. |
| 6713210 | The user prefers PDCA summaries to show only the dual links and next decisions to be made, while including detailed information in the full PDCA. |
| 6713189 | The user prefers that the assistant provide bulk content in files and include only relevant links and decisions in the chat. |
| 6713175 | User prefers rich content in PDCA documents and minimal content in chat responses, including only perfect clickable links and decisions. |
| 6692615 | Successfully created automated test suite for TSRanger v2.2 with 32 test cases from comprehensive testing matrix. Features: requirement UUID to test UUID mapping, non-interactive testing protocol, ANSI code parsing, comprehensive test report generation, and accurate functional bug detection (correctly identified 0/32 tests pass due to existing bugs). Located at components/TSRanger/v2.2/test/comprehensive-test-automation.js with testreport.md output. |
| 6434412 | When performing development tasks, switch to the developer role. |
| 6434401 | In tsranger test, pressing [down] or [up] navigates only the command (no method shown). Methods appear only after [tab] or [right], with [tab] and [right] behaving identically. |
| 6431723 | When the user says 'pdca', the assistant should proceed with planned steps and the next PDCA cycle. |
| 6431713 | The user prefers that GitHub links are clickable and that local file references open the local file. |
| 6400956 | PDCAs must follow strict format: 1) Header with Date/Objective/Role/Issues, 2) Summary section with Artifact Links and QA Decisions (checkboxes), 3) Horizontal separators (---) between Plan/Do/Check/Act sections, 4) QA Feedback with verbatim quote and timestamp in Check section, 5) PDCA Process Update section, 6) Final one-line summary with emojis. Use checkboxes: [x] for completed, [ ] for pending decisions. Recovery process now automatically generates proper format with embedded reminders. Always use the newest PDCA template located at /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md with practical placeholders. |
| 6399561 | Never use Unicode characters (emojis like 🧹✅📁📊) in terminal commands as they cause hanging. Avoid overly complex compound commands with multiple && operators. Break down complex commands into simpler parts. Use plain ASCII text only in terminal commands to prevent encoding issues and hanging scripts. |
