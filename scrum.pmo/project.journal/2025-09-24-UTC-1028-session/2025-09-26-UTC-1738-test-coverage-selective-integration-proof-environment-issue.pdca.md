**Generated:** 2025-09-26 17:33:05 UTC
**Tool:** Web4TSComponent Compare
**Command:** `web4tscomponent compare "Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8, Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.8-testing"`

## Executive Summary
This analysis compares 2 components to identify architectural differences...

## File Structure Analysis  
| Entry (file/dir) | ... | Purpose | Similarity |
[GitHub](URL) \| [README.md](README.md) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Component documentation | üü® Similar (W+W)
```

**TESTING VERSION FEATURES SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED:**

### **Environment Configuration Problem**
```
ISSUE: Test environment path resolution mismatch
CAUSE: Tests expect components in project root, but test environment creates them in test/data

FAILING TEST PATTERN:
expect(existsSync(componentPath)).toBe(true);
// componentPath = "components/TestComponent/0.1.0.0"  
// Actual location = "test/data/TestComponent/0.1.0.0"

ROOT CAUSE: setTargetDirectory test override not applied in 0.3.0.10 test environment
```

```
BUSINESS LOGIC TESTS PASSING (19/37):
‚úÖ Component creation methods working
‚úÖ Upgrade functionality operational  
‚úÖ File protection measures active
‚úÖ Command chaining context management
‚úÖ Tree method functionality
‚úÖ Version increment calculations
