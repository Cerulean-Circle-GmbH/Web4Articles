### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Environment Setup: Successfully reset to main branch and created session directory
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for coordination and management focus
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and testing
  - e) Switch to specialized role based on focus area selection

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish clear work direction through startup decision framework

**Requirements Traceability:** README.md startup protocol compliance

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Environment Initialization:** Reset to main branch, create session directory, read PDCA framework
- **Decision Presentation:** Follow startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md
- **Session Setup:** Create dev branch after user decisions, establish work direction

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Completed**

**1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Reset to main branch as per memory 7495247
git reset --hard origin/main && git checkout main
# Create session directory
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-24-UTC-1028-session
```

**2. Documentation Review**
- Read README.md startup protocol
- Read PDCA framework documentation (howto.PDCA.md)
- Read startup decision framework (PDCA.howto.decide.md)
- Applied memory guidance for process compliance

**3. Project Status Creation**
- Created project.status.md with current state
- Documented clean working directory
- Established session context and next steps

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Environment Setup (✅ COMPLETED)**
```
Working directory: /Users/Shared/Workspaces/temp/Web4Articles
Branch: main (reset from save/start)
Status: Clean working tree
Session directory: Created successfully
```

**Documentation Framework (✅ READY)**
```
PDCA howto.PDCA.md: Read and understood
Startup decision framework: Available and applied
Template version 3.1: Loaded and ready
Memory guidance: Applied throughout process
```

**Session Readiness Verified**
- ✅ **Environment:** Clean main branch with session directory created
- ✅ **Documentation:** PDCA framework read and ready for application  
- ✅ **Decision Framework:** Standard 3 decisions prepared per startup protocol
- ✅ **Memory Compliance:** All relevant memories applied to process

**Process Integration Confirmed**
- ✅ **README Protocol:** Followed startup instructions exactly
- ✅ **PDCA Standards:** Using template version 3.1 with all mandatory sections

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Clean session startup with standard decision framework ready

**Session Foundation Enhanced:**
- **Environment:** Clean main branch reset with proper session directory structure
- **Framework:** PDCA documentation loaded and ready for consistent application
- **Decision Process:** Standard startup decisions prepared for user direction setting

**Process Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Following established startup protocol ensures reliable session initialization
- **Clarity:** Standard decision framework provides clear options for work direction

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Dev Branch Creation:** Will create timestamped dev branch after user decisions
2. **Work Direction:** Will proceed based on user's focus area and role selection
3. **Sprint Planning:** Will establish sprint cycles based on session duration choice

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: FRESH START READINESS**

### **Anticipation:**
**SYSTEMATIC** preparation creates confidence in session success and clear work direction

### **Satisfaction:**
**METHODICAL** application of startup protocol ensures nothing is missed and all frameworks are ready

### **Focus:**
**DETERMINED** readiness to serve user needs through proper decision presentation and process compliance

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Startup Framework:** Standard 3 decisions provide clear session direction options  
- ✅ **Memory Application:** Systematic application of stored guidance ensures process consistency
- ✅ **Environment Reset:** Main branch reset creates clean foundation for new work

**Quality Impact:** Proper startup protocol ensures session begins with clear direction and established frameworks

**Next PDCA Focus:** Implementation of user-selected work direction and dev branch creation
