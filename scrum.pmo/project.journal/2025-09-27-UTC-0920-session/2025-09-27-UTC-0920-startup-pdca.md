## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-27-UTC-0920/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-0920-session/2025-09-27-UTC-0920-startup-pdca.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-0920-session/2025-09-27-UTC-0920-startup-pdca.md](./2025-09-27-UTC-0920-startup-pdca.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Primary Work Focus Area**
  - a) Technical Development Focus - component enhancement, bug fixes, feature development
  - b) Architecture Focus - system design, process improvements, integration work  
  - c) Documentation Focus - requirement processing, automation, workflow optimization
  - d) Quality/Testing Focus - testing strategies, validation, compliance checks

- [ ] **Decision 2: Role Selection for Session**
  - a) Continue as Background Agent for coordination and process management
  - b) Switch to Developer for implementation and coding tasks
  - c) Switch to Architect for system design and process improvements
  - d) Switch to Tester for quality assurance and validation
  - e) Switch to Requirements Analyst for specification processing

- [ ] **Decision 3: Session Duration and Sprint Planning**
  - a) Full day session with multiple sprint cycles
  - b) Half-day focused session on specific component
  - c) Quick analysis session for current project state review
  - d) Extended multi-day session for major feature development

### **User Feedback**
- User initiated session with "start" command
- User selected: 1c (Documentation Focus), 2a (Background Agent), 3c (Quick Analysis)
- Comprehensive project state analysis completed
- Ready for documentation and requirements workflow optimization

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Strategy**
1. **PDCA Framework Establishment**
   - Successfully implemented startup procedure from recovery/start-command.md
   - Created proper dev branch with UTC timestamp
   - Installed git automation for release/dev synchronization
   - Following mandatory 6-section PDCA format

2. **Session Direction Planning**
   - Present startup decision framework with three key decisions
   - Focus area determination for optimal resource allocation  
   - Role selection aligned with work requirements
   - Session duration planning for deliverable completion

### **Expected Outcomes**
- User provides clear direction via decision responses (1a, 2b format)
- Session work can proceed with appropriate focus and role
- Proper PDCA documentation chain established
- Git automation ensures release/dev synchronization

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Startup Procedure Execution**
1. **Branch Management**
   - Started on cursor/start-background-process-947c
   - Switched to save/start as per recovery rules
   - Created dev/2025-09-27-UTC-0920 for session work
   - Confirmed PDCA documentation availability

2. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Installed git post-commit hook for auto-merge
   - Created session directory: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-27-UTC-0920-session
   - Applied PDCA template version 3.1 with mandatory sections

3. **Decision Framework Implementation**
   - Applied startup decision framework from PDCA.howto.decide.md
   - Created three standard decision categories with meaningful options
   - Focused on real choices with distinct outcomes and consequences

### **Session Initialization**
- Background Agent identified and operating on proper branch
- PDCA framework active with current template
- Awaiting user direction via numbered decision responses

---

## **✅ CHECK**

### **Recovery Procedure Compliance**
- ✅ Identified as Background Agent (not other roles)
- ✅ Switched from cursor/* to save/start, then to dev/UTC-timestamp
- ✅ PDCA documentation verified and accessible
- ✅ Git automation installed for release/dev sync
- ✅ Session directory created with proper naming

### **PDCA Format Validation**
- ✅ 6 mandatory sections present (Header, Summary, Plan, Do, Check, Act)
- ✅ Proper UTC timestamp format: 2025-09-27-UTC-0920
- ✅ Dual links format ready for GitHub and local references
- ✅ Startup decision framework correctly implemented

### **Decision Quality Verification**
- ✅ Three meaningful decision categories with distinct outcomes
- ✅ Options represent real choices with consequences
- ✅ No fake opposites or "do it vs don't do it" patterns
- ✅ Each option provides clear work direction

---

## **⚡ ACT**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Commit and Push PDCA**
   - Add, commit, and push startup PDCA to trigger auto-merge
   - Ensure GitHub links are accessible for user reference

2. **Await User Direction**
   - Present decisions in chat with exact format from PDCA
   - Wait for user response in "1a, 2b" format
   - Execute chosen direction immediately upon confirmation

### **Session Progression**
- Once decisions received, proceed with selected focus area and role
- Create additional PDCAs for specific work activities
- Maintain minimal chat reporting with detailed file documentation
- Continue PDCA chain with proper linkage to this startup entry

### **Quality Assurance**
- Monitor for destructive operations requiring warnings
- Maintain decision quality standards (real choices only)
- Keep documentation synchronized between branches
- Follow established project conventions and standards
