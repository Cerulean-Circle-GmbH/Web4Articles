**Date**: 2025-08-20 05:00  
**Role**: Scrum Master  
**Session Type**: Recovery and Branch Migration Planning  

## Session Context

### QA User Request
"recover from readme as scrum masters"

### Current Situation
- The release/dev branch is broken
- Need to safely bring this branch onto a newer version
- Performing Scrum Master role recovery to understand project context

## Actions Taken

### 1. Scrum Master Recovery Process

Following the README.md recovery procedure, I performed the following steps:

1. **Read Core Documentation**
   - Reviewed README.md focusing on Scrum Master role definition
   - Read `/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md`
   - Analyzed recovery.md for historical context

2. **Key Findings About Scrum Master Role**
   - Primary role: AI acts as Scrum Master interacting with user as QA auditor
   - Core responsibilities:
     - Impediment removal and fixing blockers
     - Team management (hiring and managing SCRUM roles)
     - Documentation and traceability of all QA feedback
     - Process oversight and SCRUM artifact management
     - Verification of automated actions

3. **Project State Assessment**
   - Project: Web4Articles - md-file based WIKI for CIRAS Project
   - Management: AI-managed following CMMI Level 4 SCRUM
   - Tech Stack: TypeScript ESM, Radical OOP, Vitest testing
   - Multiple sprints completed (0-5)
   - TSRanger interactive shell implemented

### 2. Documentation Created

Created `/workspace/scrum-master-recovery.md` containing:
- Comprehensive Scrum Master role definition
- Recovery process steps
- AI Task Creation Protocol
- Commit & Push best practices
- Current project state summary

### 3. Branch Migration Planning

#### Issue Identified
- The release/dev branch is reported as broken
- Need to safely migrate current work to a newer version

#### Migration Strategy (To Be Implemented)
1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Identify specific issues with release/dev branch
   - Compare current branch with main/master
   - Document breaking changes or conflicts

2. **Preparation Phase**
   - Ensure all current work is committed and pushed
   - Create backup branch of current state
   - Document all pending changes

3. **Migration Phase**
   - Create new branch from stable base (main/master)
   - Cherry-pick or rebase necessary commits
   - Resolve conflicts carefully
   - Test thoroughly after migration

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify all functionality works
   - Document migration results

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Commit and push current recovery documentation
   - Investigate the specific issues with release/dev branch
   - Create detailed migration plan

2. **Follow-up Tasks**
   - Execute branch migration strategy
   - Update team on migration progress
   - Document lessons learned for future reference
