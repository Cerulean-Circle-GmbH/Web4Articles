# Branch Migration Plan: Safely Moving to Newer Version

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Issue**: release/dev branch is broken  
**Objective**: Safely migrate current branch to a newer, stable version  

## Current Situation Analysis

### Known Issues
- The release/dev branch is reported as broken (specific issues to be investigated)
- Need to preserve current work while moving to a stable base

### Prerequisites for Migration
1. All current work must be committed and pushed
2. Clear understanding of what's broken in release/dev
3. Identification of a stable target branch/version

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Backup (Day 1)
1. **Document Current State**
   - List all modified files
   - Note any uncommitted changes
   - Record current branch name and commit hash

2. **Investigate release/dev Issues**
   - Check build/test failures
   - Identify breaking changes
   - Document specific problems

3. **Create Safety Backup**
   ```bash
   git branch backup/pre-migration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   git push origin backup/pre-migration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

### Phase 2: Preparation (Day 1-2)
1. **Identify Target Branch**
   - Determine most stable base (likely main/master)
   - Check compatibility with current work
   - Note any dependency updates needed

2. **Analyze Differences**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
   ```

3. **Prepare Migration Checklist**
   - List all commits to preserve
   - Identify potential conflicts
   - Plan resolution strategy

### Phase 3: Migration Execution (Day 2-3)
1. **Create New Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout origin/main
   git checkout -b feature/migrated-scrum-master-work
   ```

2. **Apply Changes**
   - Option A: Cherry-pick specific commits
   - Option B: Rebase if history is clean
   - Option C: Manual re-application if conflicts are severe

3. **Resolve Conflicts**
   - Document each conflict resolution
   - Ensure no functionality is lost
   - Maintain project first principles

### Phase 4: Verification (Day 3-4)
1. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run vitest
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test TSRanger functionality
   - Verify all CLI commands
   - Check documentation links

3. **Code Review**
   - Review all migrated changes
   - Ensure compliance with project standards
   - Verify no accidental removals

### Phase 5: Finalization (Day 4)
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Document migration process
   - Update recovery.md
   - Add lessons learned

2. **Communicate Changes**
   - Update team on new branch
   - Document any breaking changes
   - Provide migration guide for others

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Mitigated by comprehensive backups
2. **Feature Regression**: Mitigated by thorough testing
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Mitigated by careful conflict resolution
4. **Dependency Issues**: Mitigated by dependency analysis

### Rollback Plan
If migration fails:
1. Return to backup branch
2. Document failure reasons
3. Revise strategy
4. Retry with adjustments

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass on new branch
- [ ] No functionality lost
- [ ] Clean git history maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team informed of changes

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Assessment and Backup
- **Day 2**: Preparation and Migration Start
- **Day 3**: Migration Completion and Testing
- **Day 4**: Verification and Finalization
