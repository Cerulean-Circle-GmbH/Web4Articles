## **üìã Plan**

### **Migration Strategy Overview**
1. **Assessment Phase**: Understand what's broken in release/dev
2. **Backup Phase**: Create safety backup of current work
3. **Migration Phase**: Move to stable branch with cherry-picks/rebase
4. **Verification Phase**: Test all functionality after migration
5. **Documentation Phase**: Update team and document lessons learned

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Create comprehensive backups before any migration
- Document each step for rollback capability
- Test thoroughly after each migration step
- Maintain communication with QA throughout

### **Success Criteria**
- All tests pass on new branch
- No functionality lost during migration
- Clean git history maintained
- Team informed of changes
