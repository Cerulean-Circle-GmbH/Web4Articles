### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Test Analysis**: Completed - 12 failing tests identified with specific issues
- [x] **Priority Assessment**: Completed - Path resolution and functionality gaps prioritized
- [ ] **Decision 1: Development Approach Priority**
  - a) **Fix Path Resolution First** - Address /workspace vs actual path issues for test stability
  - b) **Fix Functionality First** - Implement missing methods (validate, transform, addExecutionCapability)
  - c) **Parallel Approach** - Fix both path and functionality issues simultaneously
  - d) **Refactor Tests** - Update test expectations to match current implementation

- [ ] **Decision 2: Test Environment Strategy**
  - a) **Mock /workspace Environment** - Create test doubles for workspace paths
  - b) **Dynamic Path Resolution** - Update tests to use actual project paths
  - c) **Hybrid Approach** - Use both mocking and dynamic paths where appropriate
  - d) **Test Isolation** - Completely isolate tests from filesystem dependencies

- [ ] **Decision 3: Implementation Completeness**
  - a) **Minimal Fixes** - Fix only failing tests to pass
  - b) **Full Implementation** - Complete all missing functionality properly
  - c) **Incremental Development** - Fix tests in phases with proper implementation
  - d) **Architecture Review** - Assess if current design needs fundamental changes

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Critical Test Failure Analysis:**

**1. Path Resolution Issues (8 tests):**
- Tests expect `/workspace` directory but running in actual project path
- `process.chdir('/workspace')` fails - directory doesn't exist
- Need dynamic path resolution or proper test environment setup

**2. Functionality Gaps (4 tests):**
- `validate()` method returns Unit object instead of boolean
- `transform()` method returns undefined instead of transformed data
- `addExecutionCapability()` method not updating capabilities array
- Central storage path resolution failing

**3. Symlink Conflicts:**
- Multiple EEXIST errors for existing symlinks in scenarios/ontology/
- Tests creating conflicting symlinks without proper cleanup

### **Development Priority Plan:**

**Phase 1: Path Resolution (Critical)**
1. Fix test environment path assumptions
2. Implement proper workspace detection
3. Update test cleanup procedures

**Phase 2: Core Functionality (Essential)**
1. Fix `validate()` method to return boolean
2. Implement proper `transform()` method
3. Fix `addExecutionCapability()` method
4. Resolve central storage path issues

**Phase 3: Test Stability (Quality)**
1. Implement proper test isolation
2. Fix symlink cleanup procedures
3. Ensure test repeatability

### **Technical Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Vitest (mandatory) for all test fixes
- Maintain ESM-native TypeScript approach
- Follow Web4 component architecture patterns
- Ensure backward compatibility

## **🔧 DO** 

### **Test Failure Investigation Completed:**

**Path Resolution Analysis:**
- Tests assume `/workspace` as project root but actual path is `/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles`
- `afterEach` cleanup fails with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, chdir '/workspace'`
- Need to replace hardcoded `/workspace` with dynamic project root detection

**Functionality Analysis:**
- `unit.validate()` returns Unit object instead of boolean (should return `true`/`false`)
- `unit.transform()` returns `undefined` instead of transformation result object
- `unit.addExecutionCapability()` not persisting capabilities to model
- Central storage expects `/workspace/scenarios/index/` but should use actual project path

**Symlink Conflict Analysis:**
- Tests creating symlinks in `scenarios/ontology/` that already exist
- Need proper cleanup or unique test paths to prevent conflicts
- EEXIST errors indicate insufficient test isolation

### **Development Environment Prepared:**
- Unit component 0.3.0.5 located and analyzed
- Test files identified: `unit.acceptance.test.ts` and `unit.filename.consistency.test.ts`
- Source files structure understood: layer2 (DefaultUnit.ts), layer3 (interfaces), layer4 (TSCompletion.js)
- Vitest configuration confirmed for ESM-native testing

## **✅ CHECK**

### **Test Failure Classification:**
- **Critical Path Issues**: 8 tests failing due to `/workspace` hardcoding
- **Functionality Bugs**: 4 tests failing due to incomplete method implementations
- **Environment Issues**: Symlink conflicts and cleanup failures
- **Total Impact**: 12/19 tests failing (63% failure rate)

### **Root Cause Identification:**
1. **Hardcoded Paths**: Tests assume Docker/container environment with `/workspace`
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: Core methods not fully implemented per test expectations
3. **Test Isolation**: Insufficient cleanup causing cross-test interference
4. **Path Abstraction**: Missing dynamic project root detection

### **Technical Debt Assessment:**
- TSCompletion.js in layer4 (should be TypeScript .ts file)
- Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript in same component
- Test environment assumptions not matching development environment
- Missing proper error handling in core methods

### **Quality Impact:**
Current test failures prevent reliable component usage and development confidence. Need systematic resolution to ensure component stability and Web4 architecture compliance.
