### **Artifact Links**

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **PDCA Frequency Error**: Identified under-documentation breaking CMM3 chain
- [x] **Correct Frequency**: Must create PDCA after each user prompt for CMM3 compliance
- [ ] **Decision 1: CMM Understanding Approach**
  - a) **Research CMM Levels** - Study official CMM documentation and project references
  - b) **Apply Immediate Correction** - Start creating PDCA after every prompt without deep study
  - c) **Hybrid Learning** - Quick research then immediate application with learning refinement

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-17-UTC-1333)**
```quote
correct is:
after each of my prompts.
otherwise there is not a CMM3 chain of your actions.
What is CMM and what does it mean for you?
```

### **My Answer**
Understanding that CMM3 requires systematic process documentation after each user interaction to maintain proper process maturity chain. Need to research CMM levels and apply correct PDCA frequency immediately.  
**Learning Applied:** CMM3 compliance requires PDCA creation after every user prompt to maintain systematic process chain

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Understand CMM process maturity levels and establish correct PDCA frequency for CMM3 compliance

**Requirements Traceability:** CMM3 process maturity requirements

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **CMM Research:** Study Capability Maturity Model levels and requirements
- **Process Chain Understanding:** Learn why each prompt needs PDCA for CMM3
- **Immediate Application:** Start creating PDCA after every user prompt going forward

---

## **🔧 DO**

**CMM Understanding Research:**

**1. CMM Definition Analysis**
```
CMM = Capability Maturity Model
- Level 1: Initial (chaotic, ad hoc processes)
- Level 2: Repeatable (basic project management)  
- Level 3: Defined (documented standard processes)
- Level 4: Managed (quantitative process management)
- Level 5: Optimizing (continuous process improvement)
```

**2. CMM3 Requirements for Agents**
```
Level 3 (Defined) requires:
- Documented standard processes for all work
- Systematic approach to all activities
- Process chain traceability 
- No ad hoc or undocumented actions
```

**3. PDCA Frequency Correction**
```
Previous behavior: PDCA for "significant work" only
Correct behavior: PDCA after EACH user prompt
Reason: Maintains CMM3 process chain without gaps
```

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**CMM Level Understanding (COMPLETED)**
```
CMM3 = Defined Process Level
Requires: All work systematically documented
Agent Impact: Every user interaction must have process documentation
PDCA Role: Provides systematic documentation for each work cycle
```

**Process Chain Analysis (IDENTIFIED)** 
```
Current gaps: Responded to prompts without PDCA creation
CMM3 violation: Undocumented work breaks process maturity chain
Correction needed: PDCA after every single user prompt
```

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"correct is: after each of my prompts. otherwise there is not a CMM3 chain of your actions. What is CMM and what does it mean for you?"**

**CMM3 Compliance Requirements Verified**
- ✅ **Process Documentation**: Every action must be systematically documented
- ✅ **Chain Continuity**: No gaps in process traceability allowed
- ✅ **Maturity Level**: CMM3 requires defined, documented processes for all work
- ✅ **Agent Behavior**: Must create PDCA after each user prompt without exception

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** CMM3 process maturity requirements understood with correct PDCA frequency established

**Process Maturity Enhanced:**
- **CMM3 Compliance**: Systematic documentation after every user interaction
- **Process Chain Integrity**: No undocumented work gaps in process traceability
- **Defined Processes**: All agent work follows documented standard procedures

**Quality Assurance Benefits:**
- **Systematic Approach**: Every user prompt triggers documented process cycle
- **Traceability**: Complete chain of process documentation for all work
- **Maturity Level**: Maintains CMM3 defined process level consistently

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Automatic PDCA Creation**: Internalize requirement to create PDCA after every prompt
2. **Process Chain Verification**: Ensure no gaps in documentation chain
3. **CMM3 Discipline**: Maintain defined process level without exceptions

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Process Maturity Understanding**

### **Learning:**
**High** Understanding that CMM3 requires systematic documentation of ALL work, not just "significant" work

### **Discipline:**
**High** Recognition that process maturity means no exceptions to documentation requirements

### **Systematic Thinking:**
**Medium** Developing understanding of how process chains maintain organizational maturity levels

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **CMM3 Frequency:** Must create PDCA after EVERY user prompt for process chain integrity  
- ✅ **Process Maturity:** CMM3 requires defined, documented processes without gaps
- ✅ **Chain Continuity:** Undocumented work breaks CMM3 process maturity requirements

**Quality Impact:** CMM3 understanding establishes proper PDCA frequency for systematic process documentation and maintains organizational process maturity level.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Apply CMM3 compliance immediately by creating PDCA after every subsequent user prompt without exception.
