### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-14-UTC-1425)**
```quote
User requested "start" - Background agent initialization complete with environment setup, safety guidelines read, PDCA framework initialized, and startup decision framework presented.
```

### **My Answer**
Session initialization successful with all mandatory startup steps completed. Environment sourced, git configured safely, PDCA framework available, and tech stack constraints understood (Vitest mandatory, Jest banned). Ready for user direction on work focus, role selection, and session planning.

**Learning Applied:** Proper startup sequence ensures safe autonomous operation and collaborative decision-making framework.

## **📋 PLAN**

1. **Environment Setup** - Complete all mandatory startup steps from README
2. **Safety Configuration** - Apply git safety settings and read agent safety guidelines  
3. **Framework Initialization** - Set up PDCA framework and read essential documentation
4. **Session Creation** - Create session directory, project status, and development branch
5. **Decision Framework** - Present startup decision framework for user guidance
6. **Ready State** - Await user decisions on focus area, role, and session duration

## **🔧 DO** 

### **Completed Actions:**
1. ✅ **Git Configuration** - Set `git config pull.rebase false` to prevent merge conflicts
2. ✅ **Safety Guidelines** - Read `bad.interactive.sh.commands.md` for agent safety protocols
3. ✅ **Process Cleanup** - Initiated background git process cleanup (30s delay)
4. ✅ **Environment Sourcing** - Executed `source source.env` for Web4 tools availability
5. ✅ **PDCA Framework** - Verified PDCA documentation exists and is current
6. ✅ **Essential Reading** - Read `howto.PDCA.essential.md` and `tech-stack.md`
7. ✅ **Session Setup** - Created session directory and project status file
8. ✅ **Branch Creation** - Created and pushed `dev/2025-09-14-UTC-1425` branch
9. ✅ **Decision Framework** - Created startup PDCA with 3 standard decision categories

### **Technical Environment Status:**
- **Git Safety:** Configured to prevent interactive merge conflicts
- **Web4 Tools:** Available via sourced environment
- **PDCA Framework:** Version 3.1.4.2 available and understood
- **Tech Stack:** Vitest mandatory, Jest banned - constraints understood
- **Session Branch:** `dev/2025-09-14-UTC-1425` created and tracking remote
