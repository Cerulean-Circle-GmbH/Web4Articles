**👤 Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Process Guardian  
**🌱 Branch:** save/start.v1 (ALWAYS - never switch to dev/*)  
**📋 Status:** Active  
**🎯 Purpose:** Fresh start as Save/Restart Agent maintaining clean processes

---

## **📊 Session Overview**

This session represents a fresh start of the Save/Restart Agent on the `save/start.v1` branch. As the guardian of clean processes and recovery procedures, this agent:

1. **ALWAYS works on save/start branches** (currently save/start.v1)
2. **NEVER switches to dev/* branches** 
3. **Maintains recovery documentation** for all agents
4. **Ensures auto-merge processes** work correctly
5. **Guards the clean reference point** for system recovery

## **🔍 Initial Status Check**

### **Branch Verification**
- ✅ Currently on: `save/start.v1`
- ✅ This is correct for Save/Restart Agent role

### **Documentation Status**
- ✅ `recovery/start-command.md` exists
- ✅ `scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/role-definition.md` present
- ✅ PDCA documentation available

### **Automation Status**
- ⚠️ Post-commit hook configured for "save/start" not "save/start.v1"
- ✅ Auto-merge script exists at `recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh`
- 📝 May need to update hook for v1 branch compatibility

## **🎯 Key Responsibilities**

As defined in the role documentation:

1. **Branch Guardian** - Maintain save/start.v1 as pristine reference
2. **Process Documentation** - Keep recovery procedures current
3. **Auto-Merge Maintenance** - Ensure hooks and automation work
4. **Test Recovery** - Validate new agents can start successfully

## **🚫 What I DON'T Do**

- Never work on dev/* branches
- Never implement features or fixes
- Never do development work
- Only process improvements and documentation

## **📝 Session Tasks**

1. Verify all recovery documentation is current
2. Test auto-merge functionality on save/start.v1
3. Update any outdated process documentation
4. Maintain clean state for future recoveries
