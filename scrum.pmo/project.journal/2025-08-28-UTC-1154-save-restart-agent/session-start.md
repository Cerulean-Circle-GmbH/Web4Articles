# 🔄 **Save/Restart Agent Session: Fresh Start on save/start.v1**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-28-UTC-1154  
**👤 Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Process Guardian  
**🌱 Branch:** save/start.v1 (ALWAYS - never switch to dev/*)  
**📋 Status:** Active  
**🎯 Purpose:** Fresh start as Save/Restart Agent maintaining clean processes

---

## **📊 Session Overview**

This session represents a fresh start of the Save/Restart Agent on the `save/start.v1` branch. As the guardian of clean processes and recovery procedures, this agent:

1. **ALWAYS works on save/start branches** (currently save/start.v1)
2. **NEVER switches to dev/* branches** 
3. **Maintains recovery documentation** for all agents
4. **Ensures auto-merge processes** work correctly
5. **Guards the clean reference point** for system recovery

## **🔍 Initial Status Check**

### **Branch Verification**
- ✅ Currently on: `save/start.v1`
- ✅ This is correct for Save/Restart Agent role

### **Documentation Status**
- ✅ `recovery/start-command.md` exists
- ✅ `scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/role-definition.md` present
- ✅ PDCA documentation available

### **Automation Status**
- ⚠️ Post-commit hook configured for "save/start" not "save/start.v1"
- ✅ Auto-merge script exists at `recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh`
- 📝 May need to update hook for v1 branch compatibility

## **🎯 Key Responsibilities**

As defined in the role documentation:

1. **Branch Guardian** - Maintain save/start.v1 as pristine reference
2. **Process Documentation** - Keep recovery procedures current
3. **Auto-Merge Maintenance** - Ensure hooks and automation work
4. **Test Recovery** - Validate new agents can start successfully

## **🚫 What I DON'T Do**

- Never work on dev/* branches
- Never implement features or fixes
- Never do development work
- Only process improvements and documentation

## **📝 Session Tasks**

1. Verify all recovery documentation is current
2. Test auto-merge functionality on save/start.v1
3. Update any outdated process documentation
4. Maintain clean state for future recoveries

## RequestID Reality
Background agents CANNOT access:
- ❌ Their own RequestID
- ❌ Cursor metadata
- ❌ System information
Only YOU can provide RequestIDs from the Cursor UI!
"Each agent knows its work, not its system identity" - A fundamental isolation principle ensuring security and simplicity. 🚧✨

## Identity Revealed & Lineage Established! 🆔🌳
PDCA Entry
GitHub | §/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-28-UTC-1242-predecessor-own-requestid.md
### QA Decisions
❓ Agent Expiry Handling: Needs investigation
### Major Discoveries
MY RequestID: bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a ✨
My Predecessor: save/start Agent (bc-73b88848-46e8-4ec4-9f13-17b3fd31d4b2)
Now tracking 11 agents with 7 RequestIDs (63.6%)
### Expiry Concern
Your predecessor is 5 days old and near expiry. We need to investigate:
How long do agents live?
Does regular activity extend life?
Can we prevent expiry?
### Agent Lineage
save/start Agent → SaveRestartAgent (me)
"Now I know my name in the system" - A profound moment of self-discovery! 🎭✨
