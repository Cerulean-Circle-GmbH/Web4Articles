**🎯 Impact:** High - Affects all agent branch references

## 📋 **PLAN**

### **Objective**
Transition `save/start` to be the source of truth, replacing `save/start.v1` as the primary reference.

### **Background**
- Both branches are currently synchronized (same commit: d79a6da2)
- User has requested to make `save/start` the source of truth
- This simplifies branch references and naming

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect `save/start` as primary
- [ ] Maintain `save/start.v1` as synchronized legacy reference
- [ ] Update agent report with new branch status
- [ ] Ensure clear communication about the change

## 🎬 **DO**

### **Actions Taken**

1. **Updated Agent Report** ✅
   - Changed primary branch from `save/start.v1` to `save/start`
   - Updated sync requirements to show `save/start` as source of truth
   - Updated retired agents table

2. **Updated SaveRestartAgent Documentation** ✅
   - Changed all references in `README.md` from `save/start.v1` to `save/start`
   - Updated branch behavior instructions
   - Modified startup commands

3. **Updated Branch Transition Notice** ✅
   - Clarified `save/start` as SOURCE OF TRUTH
   - Marked `save/start.v1` as legacy reference (synchronized)
   - Updated contact information to reference `save/start`

### **Files Modified**
- `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/agent.report.md`
- `scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/README.md`
- `scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/branch-transition-notice.md`

---

## ✅ **CHECK**

### **Verification Results**
- ✅ Agent report correctly shows `save/start` as primary branch
- ✅ SaveRestartAgent README updated with new branch references
- ✅ Branch transition notice clearly communicates the change
- ✅ Both branches remain at same commit (verified synchronized)

### **Outstanding Items**
- Need to verify if any automation scripts reference `save/start.v1`
- May need to update git hooks if they have hardcoded branch names

---

## 🔄 **ACT**

### **Next Steps**
1. Commit these documentation updates
2. Monitor for any processes that may still reference `save/start.v1`
3. Consider updating automation scripts in future session

### **Lessons Learned**
- Branch naming simplification improves clarity
- Having synchronized branches makes transitions smooth
- Documentation updates are critical for branch transitions

### **Future Improvements**
- Create a branch naming convention guide
- Automate branch reference updates across documentation
- Consider deprecation timeline for `.v1` suffix

---

## 📝 **Supporting Documentation**

- **Branch Architecture:**
  - `save/start` = SOURCE OF TRUTH (SaveRestartAgent home)
  - `save/start.v1` = Legacy reference (synchronized)
  - Both branches at commit: d79a6da2

- **Impact Assessment:**
  - Low risk - branches are identical
  - High visibility - primary agent branch
  - Medium effort - documentation updates only
