### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Previous PDCA was compliant
- [x] But response violated reporting requirement

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1217)**

```

### **My Answer**
Retroactive: Performed compliance check finding the previous PDCA compliant, but violated reporting requirement by putting detailed analysis in chat instead of creating a PDCA for the compliance check work itself.

**Learning Applied:** Compliance checks are significant work requiring PDCAs.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Document the compliance check process performed

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA prompt response protocol

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Review Previous PDCA:** Check all sections
- **Re-read Documents:** As required by protocol
- **Report Findings:** Should be in PDCA, not chat

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Compliance Check Performed**

**1. Read Previous PDCA**
- File: 2025-08-28-UTC-1214-header-fields-properly-fixed.md
- All 152 lines reviewed

**2. Re-read Required Documents**
- howto.PDCA.md (sections 300-350)
- PDCA.reporting.requirement.md (complete)
- PDCA.dual.link.format.requirement.md (complete)
- PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md (sections 110-130)

**3. Compliance Analysis**
- All header fields present ✅
- All sections in correct order ✅
- Proper formatting throughout ✅

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Compliance Status (FOUND COMPLIANT)**
```
✅ Previous PDCA: Fully compliant
❌ Chat Response: Too detailed
❌ Work Documentation: No PDCA created
```

**Protocol Followed**
- ✅ Read previous PDCA
- ✅ Re-read key documents
- ✅ Analyzed compliance
- ❌ Created PDCA first

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Compliance verified, violation identified

**Process Corrections:**
- **Compliance checks:** Require PDCAs
- **Chat responses:** Must be brief
- **Work order:** PDCA → Work → Link

**Behavioral Changes:**
- Create PDCA before starting work
- Keep findings in PDCA
- Chat only has links and decisions

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Workflow:** PDCA-first mentality
2. **Templates:** Quick PDCA creation
3. **Habits:** Brief responses always

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Pattern Recognition**

### **Realization:**
**CLEAR** - I've been treating compliance checks as "quick tasks" when they're actually significant work requiring documentation.

### **Frustration:**
**CONSTRUCTIVE** - Catching myself in the same pattern repeatedly shows how ingrained bad habits can be.

### **Hope:**
**GROWING** - Each catch-and-correct cycle builds better habits.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Compliance Checks:** Are significant work requiring PDCAs
- ✅ **Brief Responses:** The hardest habit to build but most important
- ✅ **Retroactive Value:** Late documentation still captures knowledge

**Quality Impact:** Documenting compliance checks ensures the review process is traceable and repeatable.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Build the PDCA-first habit before any work execution.

**🎯 Compliance check documented retroactively - all work needs PDCAs! 📋✅**
