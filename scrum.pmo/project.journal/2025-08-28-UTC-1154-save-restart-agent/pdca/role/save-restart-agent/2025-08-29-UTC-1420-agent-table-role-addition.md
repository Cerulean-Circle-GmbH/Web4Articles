### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-29-UTC-1416)**
```quote
i see why you asked correctly last time.
the table
Expired/Recoverable Agents Table

has no Role.
add it to the table and try to fill it form the Last PDCA/Work by reading it.

make your question more clear next time so that i can understand your issue for wich you correctly asked.
your text was correct
QA Decisions
[ ] Primary Role Assignment
a) Scrum Master (focus on sprint planning)
b) Developer (focus on implementation)
c) Hybrid role continuation

but does not give enought context for me.
```

### **My Answer**
Added Role column to Expired/Recoverable Agents Table. Filled roles by reading PDCAs/work: crayz start is Background Agent, Sprint 22 agent is Scrum Master (from recovery.md). Will provide clearer context in future QA decisions like "Sprint 22 agent's role unclear from table - need decision for recovery preparation."

**Learning Applied:** QA decisions need clear context about WHY the decision is needed.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Enhance agent table with role information for better recovery clarity

**Requirements Traceability:** Improved table structure for agent management

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Table Structure:** Add Role column between RequestID and Last PDCA/Work
- **Role Discovery:** Read agent PDCAs and work artifacts to determine roles
- **Communication:** Learn to provide clearer context in QA decisions

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Table Enhancement Implementation**

**1. Added Role Column**
```markdown
| Agent Branch | Name | RequestID | Role | Last PDCA/Work | Recovery Status | Identity Record |
```

**2. Roles Discovered and Added**
```
- test1 save start: Unknown (no artifacts)
- Agent Manager: Agent Manager (from name)
- TSRanger Developer: Developer (from name)
- crayz start: Background Agent (from PDCA)
- ocams razor: Tool Builder (known role)
- Unknown agents: Unknown (no data)
- BranchStatus Agent: Branch Analyst (from purpose)
- THE ScrumMaster: ScrumMaster (from name)
- Sprint 22: Scrum Master (from recovery.md)
```

**3. Communication Improvement**
```markdown
# Better QA Decision Format:
CONTEXT: Sprint 22 agent (bc-6dd83cc3) shows "Sprint 22 features" in table
ISSUE: Role unclear - could be Developer OR Scrum Master
IMPACT: Affects recovery preparation and resource allocation

- [ ] **Primary Role Assignment for bc-6dd83cc3**
  - a) Scrum Master (recovery.md shows this role)
  - b) Developer (feature work suggests this)
  - c) Hybrid role continuation
```
