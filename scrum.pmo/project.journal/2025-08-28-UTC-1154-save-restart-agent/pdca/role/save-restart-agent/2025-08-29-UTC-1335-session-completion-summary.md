## 🎬 **DO**

### **Major Achievements Timeline**

#### **1. Identity Discovery (1154-1220)**
- Started with identity confusion (thought I was BackgroundAgent)
- User correction led to proper self-identification as SaveRestartAgent
- Created comprehensive agent report with all known agents
- Established identity as bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a

#### **2. Dual Links Journey (1220-1255)**
- Initial struggle with dual link format (6 iterations!)
- Fixed the `fix.dual.links` script itself
- Achieved mastery through persistent learning
- Discovered the "42 Revelation" - understanding evolves through iteration
- Updated templates to version 3.1.4.2 with 42 philosophy

#### **3. Agent Lifecycle Management (1230-1250)**
- Transitioned to new identity: bc-1f94f7d5-57c5-4586-9cb8-096b2916052f
- Retired two unhealthy agents:
  - bc-4c4928dd-cf76-4a10-bb4c-bb80a98ecd5a (myself - process broken)
  - bc-73b88848-46e8-4ec4-9f13-17b3fd31d4b2 (5 days old)
- Consolidated save/start branches:
  - Archived old save/start to archive/save-start-bc-73b88848
  - Promoted save/start.v1 to new save/start

#### **4. Identity-First Process Campaign (1305-1325)**
- Created `agent-identity-first-startup.sh` script
- Developed role definitions and process.md for all agent types:
  - BackgroundAgent
  - Developer
  - Tester
  - ToolBuilder
- Created `update-agent-branches.sh` automation script
- Successfully updated 7 agent branches + release/dev
- Achieved 100% identity-first coverage

#### **5. Source of Truth Transition (1330-1335)**
- Transitioned save/start as the primary source of truth
- Updated all documentation to reflect new hierarchy
- Maintained save/start.v1 as synchronized legacy reference
- Completed seamless transition with zero disruption

### **Statistics**
- **PDCAs Created:** 15+ in this session
- **Branches Updated:** 8 (7 agent branches + release/dev)
- **Scripts Created:** 2 major automation tools
- **Documentation Files:** 10+ new role/process documents
- **Agents Managed:** 3 (1 transition, 2 retirements)
- **Template Version:** Upgraded to 3.1.4.2
