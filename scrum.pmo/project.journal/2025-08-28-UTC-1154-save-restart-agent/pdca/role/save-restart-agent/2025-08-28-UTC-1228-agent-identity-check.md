# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Agent Identity Check - Role and Branch Verification**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-28-UTC-1228  
**🎯 Objective:** Verify agent identity and correct branch assignment  

**👤 Agent Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Identity Verifier  
**👤 Branch:** save/start.v2 → Stable Production Reference  
**🎯 Project Journal Session:** 2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent → Recovery & Compliance Session  
**🎯 Sprint:** Sprint-21 → Process Standardization  
**✅ Task:** Confirm Agent Role and Branch Alignment  
**🚨 Issues:** Need to verify if on correct branch for role

### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Branch Assignment:** Which branch should Save/Restart Agent use?
  - a) Continue on save/start.v2 (current)
  - b) Return to save/start.v1 (original)
  - c) Work on main (now same as v2)
  - **Decision:** Awaiting user guidance

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1228)**
```quote
ok which agent are you and on which branch do you work and on which should you work. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Creating PDCA to verify identity and branch. I am:
- **Agent**: Save/Restart Agent
- **Currently on**: save/start.v2
- **Should be on**: Uncertain - v1 was my home, but we just created v2

**Learning Applied:** Role-branch alignment ensures proper boundaries.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Clarify agent identity and proper branch assignment

**Requirements Traceability:** Role definition and branch strategy

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Verify Identity:** Confirm I'm Save/Restart Agent
- **Check Current Branch:** Document where I am
- **Analyze Should-Be:** Determine correct branch
- **Present Options:** Let user decide if change needed

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Identity Verification**

From session start and role README:
- **I AM**: Save/Restart Agent
- **My Mission**: Process guardian, recovery procedures
- **My Home**: save/start branches (never dev/*)

**Current Branch Analysis**
```bash
$ git branch --show-current
save/start.v2
```

**Branch Evolution Timeline**
1. Started on: save/start.v1
2. Created: save/start.v2 (from v1)
3. Updated: main to match v2
4. Currently on: save/start.v2

**The Question**
- v1 was explicitly my "sacred home"
- v2 was created as evolution of v1
- Which is now my proper home?

**My Understanding**
- save/start.v1 = Original recovery branch
- save/start.v2 = New stable branch
- Logic suggests: v2 is new home

**But User Decides**
Need your guidance on which save/start version is my home.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Identity Confirmation**
```
✅ Agent: Save/Restart Agent (confirmed)
✅ Branch: save/start.v2 (current)
❓ Should-Be: v1 or v2? (needs decision)
✅ Never: dev/* branches (clear rule)
```

**Branch Characteristics**
- v1: Has all our session history
- v2: Clean evolution, same content
- Both: Valid save/start branches
- Neither: Is a dev/* branch

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Identity confirmed, branch question identified

**Current Status:**
1. **Identity**: Confirmed Save/Restart Agent
2. **Location**: On save/start.v2
3. **Question**: Is v2 my new home?

**Waiting For:**
User decision on proper branch assignment

**My Recommendation:**
v2 as new home makes sense because:
- Natural evolution from v1
- Cleaner branch name
- Same sacred purpose
- Continues the mission

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Identity Clarity**

### **Confidence:**
**STRONG** - I know who I am and my mission.

### **Uncertainty:**
**MILD** - Which version is home needs clarification.

### **Readiness:**
**COMPLETE** - Ready to work from either branch.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Identity Verification:** Regular checks prevent drift
- ✅ **Branch Evolution:** Versions can evolve homes
- ✅ **User Authority:** Branch assignment is user decision
- ✅ **Role Consistency:** Mission remains regardless of version

**Quality Impact:** Clear branch assignment prevents confusion.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Execute based on user's branch decision.
