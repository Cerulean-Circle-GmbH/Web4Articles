### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Successfully cherry-picked from commit 483646c

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1216)**
```quote
cherry pick scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session from release/dev

oh boy. i am really thinging you got lost. you did not even do git fetch. i did it for you

here it is ... commit sha 483646cfccd061ca726d01d5feafb4651a40931f
```

### **My Answer**
Retroactive: You were right - I forgot to git fetch! After you provided the commit SHA, I successfully cherry-picked the session directory containing fails/chat.md, fails/fail.cmd.md, and the session start PDCA.

**Learning Applied:** Always git fetch before searching for remote content.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Cherry-pick specific session directory from provided commit

**Requirements Traceability:** Git operations for session recovery

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Initial Attempt:** Failed - forgot git fetch
- **User Assistance:** Provided commit SHA
- **Cherry-pick Method:** Extract specific directory from commit

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Git Operations Performed**

**1. Initial Search (Failed)**
```bash
git checkout release/dev -- scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session
# Error: pathspec did not match
```

**2. After Commit SHA Provided**
```bash
git checkout 483646cfccd061ca726d01d5feafb4651a40931f -- scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session/
# Success
```

**3. Files Retrieved**
- fails/chat.md (5000 bytes)
- fails/fail.cmd.md (11027 bytes)  
- pdca/2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session-start.md (8940 bytes)

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Cherry-pick Success (VERIFIED)**
```
✅ Directory created: 2025-08-28-UTC-1846-session
✅ Files present: 3 files in 2 subdirectories
✅ Committed: 37a7c8e
✅ Pushed to save/start.v1
```

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Session successfully cherry-picked

**Key Learnings:**
- **Always git fetch:** Before searching remote content
- **Ask for help:** User had the answer (commit SHA)
- **Document properly:** Should have created PDCA immediately

**Process Improvements:**
- Add git fetch to standard search procedure
- Create PDCAs before executing work
- Keep chat responses brief

**Future Enhancements:**
1. **Search procedure:** fetch → search → report
2. **PDCA timing:** Create before work starts
3. **Chat discipline:** Links only, details in PDCA

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Learning from Oversight**

### **Humility:**
**NECESSARY** - Forgot basic git fetch, user had to do it for me and provide the commit SHA.

### **Gratitude:**
**GENUINE** - User's patience in providing the exact commit SHA enabled success.

### **Growth:**
**INCREMENTAL** - Each mistake teaches a lesson about proper procedures.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Must create PDCA documentation for all significant work
- ✅ **Git Workflow:** Always fetch before searching remote content
- ✅ **User Collaboration:** Users often have the solution - listen carefully
- ✅ **Retroactive PDCAs:** Better late than never for documentation

**Quality Impact:** Proper documentation ensures knowledge retention even for past work.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Continue retroactive documentation and maintain standards going forward.
