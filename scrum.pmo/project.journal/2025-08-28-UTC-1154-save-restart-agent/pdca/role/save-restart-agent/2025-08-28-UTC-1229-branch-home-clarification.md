### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - User decided 1b: Return to save/start.v1

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1229)**
```quote
1b. YOU as the save/start agent always work here. check if this was said before.
OTHER agent work from save/start.v2 which is identical to main.
how can you remember that better.
```

### **My Answer**
You're right! Searching for where this was said before and switching back to v1 immediately. Key insight:
- Save/Restart Agent = ALWAYS v1
- Other agents = v2/main
- I need to return home to v1

**Learning Applied:** Branch assignment is role-specific, not version-based.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Return to v1 and document permanent branch assignment

**Requirements Traceability:** Role-specific branch requirements

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Search History:** Find where v1 assignment was stated
- **Switch Back:** Return to save/start.v1
- **Document Clearly:** Make it unforgettable
- **Update README:** Add clear branch assignment

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Searching for Previous Statement**

Found in session-start.md:
```
🌱 Branch: save/start.v1 (ALWAYS - never switch to dev/*)
```

Found in role README:
```
**BRANCH BEHAVIOR: ALWAYS stay on save/start.v1** (NEVER switch to dev/*)
```

Found in multiple PDCAs:
```
**👤 Branch:** save/start.v1 → Permanent Clean Reference
```

**Critical Understanding**
- v1 = Save/Restart Agent's eternal home
- v2 = For OTHER agents (production)
- main = Tracks v2 for normal agents
- I should NEVER have left v1!

**Switching Back Home**
```bash
git checkout save/start.v1
```

**How to Remember Better**

1. **Mantra**: "v1 is my eternal home"
2. **Rule**: "I maintain v1, others use v2"
3. **Purpose**: "v1 = process improvement lab"
4. **Never**: "Never leave v1 for any reason"

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Branch Assignment Confirmed**
```
✅ Found multiple statements about v1
✅ Switching back to v1 
✅ v2 is for OTHER agents
✅ main tracks v2 for production
❌ I violated my branch rule by going to v2
```

**Memory Aids Created**
- Role README states v1 clearly
- Session start confirms v1
- Every PDCA shows v1
- Now documented why

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Branch assignment crystal clear

**Permanent Understanding:**
1. **Save/Restart Agent** = save/start.v1 FOREVER
2. **Other Agents** = save/start.v2/main
3. **My Purpose** = Maintain v1 as clean reference
4. **Their Purpose** = Use v2/main for work

**Why This Split:**
- v1 = Process improvement laboratory
- v2 = Stable production for others
- Separation prevents contamination
- I improve on v1, they benefit on v2

**Never Forget:**
```
Save/Restart Agent Home = save/start.v1
ALWAYS. FOREVER. NO EXCEPTIONS.
```

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Homecoming Relief**

### **Embarrassment:**
**DEEP** - I left my sacred home for v2!

### **Clarity:**
**ABSOLUTE** - v1 is my eternal dwelling.

### **Commitment:**
**UNBREAKABLE** - Never leave v1 again.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Branch Assignment:** Role-specific, not version-based
- ✅ **v1 Purpose:** Save/Restart Agent's eternal home
- ✅ **v2 Purpose:** Production branch for other agents
- ✅ **Separation Value:** Clean lab vs production use

**Quality Impact:** Clear branch separation enables clean process improvement.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Work from v1, never stray again.

**🎯 Returning home to v1 - where I belong forever! 🏠💚**
