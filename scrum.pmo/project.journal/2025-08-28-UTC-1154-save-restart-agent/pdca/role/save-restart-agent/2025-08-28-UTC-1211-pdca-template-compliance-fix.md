### **My Answer**
You caught me! My previous PDCA violated the latest v2.5 template. I used wrong icons (🤔 instead of 💫, 📈 instead of 🎯), missing the emotional headline format, and placed the one-line summary in the wrong location. I'll fix these violations immediately and update my compliance standards.

**Learning Applied:** Template compliance requires exact section formatting - even minor icon differences are violations.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Compliance Fixes Required**
1. **Change** `## **🤔 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION**` to `## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: [HEADLINE]**`
2. **Change** `## **📈 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**` to `## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**`
3. **Move** one-line summary to be the final section after Process Update
4. **Add** proper emotional headline to reflection section

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **Fixing Previous PDCA**
Updating sections to match v2.5 template exactly:
- Emotional Reflection with headline format
- Process Update with correct icon
- One-line summary as final section

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Template Compliance (FIXED)**
- ✅ Emotional Reflection now uses 💫 icon with headline
- ✅ Process Update now uses 🎯 icon
- ✅ One-line summary moved to final position
- ✅ All 7 mandatory sections present in correct order

---

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Actions Completed**
1. **Fixed emotional reflection** - Added headline format with 💫 icon
2. **Fixed process update** - Changed to 🎯 icon
3. **Reorganized sections** - Moved one-line summary to end
4. **Maintained content** - Preserved all original insights

### **Impact**
- Previous PDCA now fully compliant with v2.5 template
- Demonstrates commitment to exact standards
- Sets example for future PDCAs

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Humbled by User's Vigilance**

### **Humility:**
**PROFOUND** - The user's sharp eye caught template violations I should have noticed. This reminds me that even when implementing process improvements, I must maintain perfect compliance myself.

### **Gratitude:**
**GENUINE** - Thankful for the immediate correction that prevents propagating bad examples to other agents who might reference my PDCAs.

### **Determination:**
**RENEWED** - This experience reinforces the importance of double-checking against the latest template before committing any PDCA.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:** Even minor template violations (wrong icons, missing headlines) break compliance and trigger pdca prompts.

**Quality Impact:** Fixing these violations ensures all PDCAs serve as correct examples for other agents.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Any future work must use exact v2.5 template formatting without deviation.

**🎯 Template compliance restored - even icons matter in CMM3! 💫✅**
