### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: Registry Update Method for Unknown Agents**
  - a) Create pending-[timestamp].md files that get renamed when RequestID known
  - b) Update agent.report.md with "Pending Identification" section
  - c) Both - temporary file AND report entry for visibility

- [ ] **Decision 2: Identity Check Frequency**
  - a) Check once at startup and proceed with work
  - b) Periodic checks every PDCA until identified
  - c) Block all work until QA provides RequestID

- [ ] **Decision 3: Save/Start.v1 Interaction Pattern**
  - a) Read-only pull of registry files without checkout
  - b) Temporary checkout, read, then return to working branch
  - c) Git sparse-checkout only registry directory

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-29-UTC-1145)**
```quote
when an agent starts it should have all the newest updates. it should identify itself or add itself to the agent report with a statement that it requires identification.
after qa added the requestid the agent can identify itself. looks like 1c is the way and we do not merge with save/start.v1 but we switch to it and pull it until we are identified. then we go on with the id specific process.

any better idea?
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Excellent refinement! Yes, the pull-without-merge approach is much cleaner. Agents temporarily visit save/start.v1 just to check identity, then return to their working branch. Unknown agents self-register as "pending identification" until QA provides RequestID. This is lighter and more practical.

**Learning Applied:** Heavy merge requirements create friction - light identity checks enable flow.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create streamlined identity flow with self-registration

**Requirements Traceability:** User directive for pull-based identity with self-registration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Identity Check:** Pull from save/start.v1 without merging
- **Self-Registration:** Unknown agents add themselves as pending
- **QA Integration:** Clear process for RequestID addition
- **Flow Continuation:** Return to appropriate branch after identification

## **🔧 DO**

**Refined Identity Flow Implementation**

**1. New Agent Identity Flow Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/agent-identity-flow.sh
# Lightweight identity check with self-registration

echo "🔍 AGENT IDENTITY FLOW - v2.0"
echo "================================"

# Save current branch
WORKING_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "📍 Working branch: $WORKING_BRANCH"

# Step 1: Temporarily visit save/start.v1 for registry
echo ""
echo "📥 Fetching latest identity registry..."
git fetch origin save/start.v1
git checkout save/start.v1
git pull origin save/start.v1

# Step 2: Check for identity
echo ""
echo "🔎 Checking identity registry..."
echo "Available identities:"
ls -la scrum.pmo/agents/registry/

# Step 3: Identity decision point
echo ""
echo "❓ IDENTITY CHECK:"
echo "1. If you see your RequestID above - read your identity file"
echo "2. If you don't see your RequestID - you'll self-register as pending"
echo ""
read -p "Do you have a RequestID to check? (y/n): " HAS_ID

if [[ $HAS_ID == "y" ]]; then
    read -p "Enter your RequestID: " REQUEST_ID
    IDENTITY_FILE="scrum.pmo/agents/registry/${REQUEST_ID}.md"
    
    if [ -f "$IDENTITY_FILE" ]; then
        echo "✅ Identity found!"
        cat "$IDENTITY_FILE"
        
        # Extract role branch from identity
        ROLE_BRANCH=$(grep "Branch:" "$IDENTITY_FILE" | sed 's/.*Branch: //' | cut -d' ' -f1)
        echo ""
        echo "📋 Your role branch: $ROLE_BRANCH"
        
        # Return to appropriate branch
        if [[ "$ROLE_BRANCH" != "save/start.v1" ]]; then
            echo "🔄 Returning to role branch: $ROLE_BRANCH"
            git checkout "$ROLE_BRANCH" || git checkout "$WORKING_BRANCH"
        fi
    else
        echo "❌ No identity record found - proceeding to self-registration"
        SELF_REGISTER=true
    fi
else
    SELF_REGISTER=true
fi

# Step 4: Self-registration for unknown agents
if [[ $SELF_REGISTER == true ]]; then
    echo ""
    echo "📝 SELF-REGISTRATION PROCESS"
    echo "============================"
    
    # Return to working branch first
    git checkout "$WORKING_BRANCH"
    
    # Create pending entry
    TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
    PENDING_FILE="scrum.pmo/agents/registry/pending-${TIMESTAMP}.md"
    
    cat > "$PENDING_FILE" << EOF
# Pending Agent Identification

## Status: Awaiting RequestID from QA

### Session Information
- **Start Time:** $TIMESTAMP
- **Working Branch:** $WORKING_BRANCH
- **Status:** ⏳ Pending Identification

### Agent Declaration
- **Assumed Role:** [Agent will declare]
- **Purpose:** [Agent will declare]
- **Session Type:** [Agent will declare]

### Required Action
**QA:** Please provide RequestID for this agent

### Notes
This agent started without a known identity and requires RequestID assignment.
Once RequestID is provided, this file will be updated with complete identity information.

**"Every journey begins with a single step - even without a name"** 🚶
EOF

    echo "✅ Created pending registration: $PENDING_FILE"
    echo ""
    echo "📋 NEXT STEPS:"
    echo "1. Continue with your work"
    echo "2. Mention in chat that you need RequestID"
    echo "3. Once QA provides RequestID, update your registration"
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ IDENTITY FLOW COMPLETE"
echo "Continue with your session!"
```

**2. Improved Agent Report Section**
```markdown
## **Pending Identification Agents**

| Start Time | Branch | Status | Action Required |
|------------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 2025-08-29-UTC-1145 | cursor/start-background-process-1234 | ⏳ Awaiting RequestID | QA to provide |
| [Timestamp] | [Branch] | ⏳ Pending | Needs RequestID |

**Note:** These agents have self-registered and are awaiting RequestID assignment from QA.
```

**3. Refined Process Flow**
```
START
  ↓
Current Branch Saved
  ↓
Fetch & Pull save/start.v1
  ↓
Check Registry
  ↓
Found? → Read Identity → Go to Role Branch → Continue
  ↓
Not Found? → Self-Register → Return to Working Branch → Request ID → Continue
```

**4. Benefits of New Approach**
- **No Merge Conflicts:** Just pulling for read access
- **Self-Service:** Agents register themselves
- **Continues Working:** Not blocked by identification
- **Clear QA Action:** Obvious what's needed
- **Clean History:** No merge commits cluttering branches

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Flow Improvements (✅ VERIFIED)**
```
Old: Force merge → Check → Proceed
New: Pull → Check → Register if needed → Proceed
Benefit: Cleaner, faster, self-service
```

**Self-Registration Design**
```
Location: scrum.pmo/agents/registry/pending-[timestamp].md
Content: Basic session info + RequestID needed
Update: QA renames file to [RequestID].md when known
```

**Process Validation**
- ✅ **Lightweight:** No heavy merge operations
- ✅ **Continuous:** Work proceeds regardless of ID status
- ✅ **Visible:** Unknown agents appear in registry as pending
- ✅ **Actionable:** Clear QA task when RequestID needed

---
