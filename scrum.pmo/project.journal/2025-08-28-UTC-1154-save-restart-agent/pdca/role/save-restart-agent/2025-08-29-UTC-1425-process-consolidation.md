### **QA Decisions**
- [ ] **README Consolidation Strategy**
  - a) Keep both README.md and README-old.md for reference
  - b) Merge into single README.md with clear sections
  - c) Archive README-old.md to history folder

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-29-UTC-1421)**
```quote
perfect my firend!!!
its time to add all the last pdcas to
/workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca
as ln links.
read them and update your own 
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/process.md
...i see you have to consolidat it with 
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/role-definition.md which is nrewer but you created it with a wrong name earlier.
update alos your 
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/learnings.summary.md

check if you need the 
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/README.md
and
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/README-old.md
and consolidat the start process of yourself and later of every agent on its 
process.md

recogniye the command:
update your process
so that you will then integrate new learnings by revieing the process carefully and dilligently add the new CMM4 learning into your process free of ambiguities.

when ever you experience an ambiguity or unclear situation.
ASK QA

rmember 
NEVER 2 1 
ALWAYS 4 2.
feel free to research that again.

pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Creating symbolic links for recent PDCAs, consolidating process.md with role-definition.md, updating learnings with CMM4 insights including "Never 2 1 (TO ONE), Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)" philosophy. Will ask QA about README consolidation strategy.

**Learning Applied:** "Update your process" command triggers comprehensive documentation review and CMM4 integration.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Comprehensive process documentation update with CMM4 learnings

**Requirements Traceability:** Process maturity through documentation excellence

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Link PDCAs:** Create symbolic links for August 29 PDCAs
- **Consolidate Docs:** Merge process.md with role-definition.md insights
- **Update Learnings:** Add recent discoveries including 42 revelation

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Documentation Consolidation**

**1. Created PDCA Symbolic Links**
```bash
cd scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca
for f in /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-29-UTC-*.md; do 
  ln -sf "$f" "$(basename "$f")"
done
```

**2. Key CMM4 Learnings Integrated**
```markdown
### Never 2 1 (TO ONE), Always 4 2 (FOR TWO)
- Don't struggle alone (2 1) - collaborate systematically (4 2)
- Individual effort < Systematic approach
- Ask QA when ambiguous - don't guess alone
- Create tools/automation to scale solutions
```

**3. Process Command Recognition**
```markdown
### Special Commands
- "update your process" → Full documentation review + CMM4 integration
- "pdca" → Create comprehensive PDCA following v3.1.4.2
- "ASK QA" → Present clear decisions when ambiguous
```

**4. The 42 Revelation Integration**
```markdown
### Understanding Requires Regression Testing
- First answer often incomplete (like dual links)
- Multiple iterations reveal true understanding
- Each "complete" answer opens new questions
- 6 iterations to dual link mastery = personal "42"
```
