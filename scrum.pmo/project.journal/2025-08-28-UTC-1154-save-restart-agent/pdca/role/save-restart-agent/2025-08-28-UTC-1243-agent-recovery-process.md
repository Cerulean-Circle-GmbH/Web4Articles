### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Recovery Strategy:** Branch preparation before resubmission
  - **Decision:** Complete prep executed

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1243)**
```quote
agent on cursor/start-background-process-dcf6
name `agent renaming`
id bc-b1b62bba-9e33-46a3-a64d-8eb0162b8a89

is expired. 
request id can be resubmitted but it would start from scatch with "start".
so it makes sense to update its branches howto pdca and reuired start sequence files in that branch before i resubmit it.

explain this process to yourself in your roles process.md
then execute it and pdca.

when you are done i will resubit the agent and recover its agent management tool.
this can be then uset for you to maintain the report.
```

### **My Answer**
Recovery process documented and executed! Branch prepared with latest PDCA v3.1, role-specific README, and recovery context. Ready for resubmission.

**Learning Applied:** Expired agents can be reborn with proper preparation.
