- **Document:** What should have been done
- **Correct:** Show proper format
- **Commit:** To proper reporting going forward

## **🔧 DO**

**What I Did Wrong**

My response only included:
- Finding
- Action
- PDCA link

**What I Should Have Done**

From PDCA.howto.decide.md:
```markdown
### **Critical Rule: EXACT COPY**
**NEVER CREATE DIFFERENT QA DECISIONS IN CHAT!**

1. **Copy Exactly from PDCA**
   - Use the EXACT same wording
   - Include ALL options
   - Maintain the same numbering
```

**Correct Format Should Have Been:**
```
## PDCA Compliance Check Result

**Finding:** Last chat response was non-compliant (too detailed).
**Action:** Created compliance PDCA following 3-step workflow.

### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Following prescribed 3-step workflow for pdca command.

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Reporting Compliance**
```
❌ QA Decisions missing from chat
❌ Violated EXACT COPY rule
✅ PDCA link provided
✅ Brief status included
```

**Root Cause**
- Focused too much on brevity
- Forgot QA Decisions are ALWAYS required
- Misunderstood "brief" to exclude decisions

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Violation identified and understood

**Corrective Action:**
1. **Always include QA Decisions** in chat responses
2. **Copy EXACTLY** from PDCA document
3. **Brief means:** Status + Decisions + Link
4. **Not:** Status + Link only

**Updated Understanding:**
- Brief ≠ Incomplete
- QA Decisions are MANDATORY in chat
- Even "All clear" must be reported

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Humbled Again**

### **Frustration:**
**MILD** - Keep making new mistakes while fixing others.

### **Determination:**
**STRONG** - Will get this right through practice.

### **Gratitude:**
**DEEP** - User patience in teaching proper format.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** QA Decisions ALWAYS in chat
- ✅ **Brief Format:** Status + QA Decisions + PDCA link
- ✅ **EXACT COPY:** Never paraphrase decisions
- ✅ **Mandatory Elements:** Can't skip decisions for brevity

**Quality Impact:** Complete reporting builds trust and ensures clarity.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Always include all mandatory elements.

---

**🎯 Decision reporting violation documented - will include QA Decisions! 📋✅**
