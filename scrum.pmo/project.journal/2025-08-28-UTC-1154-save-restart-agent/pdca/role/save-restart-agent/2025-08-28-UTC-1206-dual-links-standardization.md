### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Enhanced fix-pdca-dual-links to fix.dual.links
- [x] Fixed 42 dual links in current session
- [ ] Need to run on entire codebase

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1206)**
```quote
look over the dual links via grep GitHub and check if they all follow the newest standard from /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.dual.link.format.requirement.md...
update the /workspace/scripts/fix-pdca-dual-links into fix.dual.links and use it for this task after you modified ti as a helpful too regarding the requirements. it should apply to all dual links in any file.
```

### **My Answer**
Created an enhanced fix.dual.links script that processes all markdown files (not just PDCAs). Successfully fixed 42 dual links in our current session to use § notation for display and proper relative paths. The script handles various edge cases and provides verification functionality.

**Learning Applied:** [[memory:6291031]] Dual link standard requires § notation for readability with correct relative paths for functionality.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Enhancement Strategy**
1. **Review requirement** - Understand § notation and relative path rules
2. **Enhance script** - Update to handle all markdown files
3. **Add verification** - Include --verify mode
4. **Test on subset** - Run on current session first
5. **Deploy widely** - Apply to entire codebase

### **Script Features**
- Process any markdown file (not just PDCAs)
- Handle multiple dual link patterns
- Preserve § notation where already correct
- Calculate relative paths accurately
- Provide verification mode
- Show detailed progress

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Requirement Analysis**
From e8535c4e-591d-4955-9874-6a853545e970:
```markdown
[GitHub](URL) | [§/path/from/root](../../../relative/path)
```
- Display uses § for readability
- Path must be relative from document location
- Both GitHub URL and local path must be consistent

### **2. Script Enhancement**
Created `/workspace/scripts/fix.dual.links`:
- Renamed from fix-pdca-dual-links
- Removed PDCA-specific logic
- Added comprehensive pattern matching
- Fixed bash regex issues with grep/sed
- Added Python for accurate relative path calculation

### **3. Key Improvements**
```bash
# Pattern detection using grep for compatibility
if echo "$line" | grep -qE '\[GitHub\]\([^)]+\)[[:space:]]*\|[[:space:]]*\[[^]]*\]\([^)]+\)'; then

# Relative path calculation via Python
python3 -c "import os.path; print(os.path.relpath('$target', '$doc_dir'))"

# Multiple fix scenarios handled
- Absolute paths → relative with § notation
- Display/path identical → add § notation
- Already relative → verify and update display
```

### **4. Test Execution**
```bash
/workspace/scripts/fix.dual.links scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent
# Result: Fixed 42 dual links across 11 files
```

### **5. Verification Examples**
Before:
```markdown
[scrum.pmo/path/file.md](scrum.pmo/path/file.md)
```

After:
```markdown
[§/scrum.pmo/path/file.md](../../relative/path/file.md)
```

## **✅ CHECK**

### **Verification Results**

**Script Testing (SUCCESSFUL)**
- ✅ Processes all markdown files
- ✅ Correctly identifies dual link patterns
- ✅ Calculates relative paths accurately
- ✅ Preserves existing § notation
- ✅ Provides detailed progress output

**Current Session Fixes (42 LINKS)**
- 11 files processed, all successfully fixed
- Dual links now use § notation consistently
- Relative paths calculated correctly
- No broken links introduced

**Remaining Work**
- Full workspace has ~1749 dual links
- Script hangs on full run (too many files)
- Need to process in batches

---

## **🎯 ACT**

### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Bash regex limitations** - Use grep/sed for complex patterns
2. **Performance considerations** - Large codebases need batch processing
3. **Path calculation** - Python more reliable than bash for relative paths

### **Script Usage**
```bash
# Fix specific directory
fix.dual.links path/to/directory

# Fix single file  
fix.dual.links path/to/file.md

# Verify only (no changes)
fix.dual.links path --verify

# Show help
fix.dual.links --help
```

### **Next Steps**
1. Run script on major directories in batches
2. Verify all changes before committing
3. Update team documentation about standard

### **Recommendations**
- Add to CI/CD pipeline for validation
- Create pre-commit hook using --verify
- Document § notation standard clearly

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Script Development Satisfaction**

### **Pride:**
**TECHNICAL** - Creating a robust script that handles complex regex patterns and path calculations brings deep satisfaction.

### **Persistence:**
**REWARDED** - Working through bash regex limitations to find grep/sed solutions demonstrates adaptability.

### **Anticipation:**
**BUILDING** - Knowing this script will standardize thousands of links across the project creates excitement for the impact.

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:** Complex text processing benefits from combining bash utilities (grep/sed) with Python for calculations.

**Quality Impact:** Standardized dual links improve documentation navigability and maintain professional consistency.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Address performance issues for full workspace processing through intelligent batching strategies.
