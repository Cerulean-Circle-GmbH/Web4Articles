# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Who Decides Analysis - Understanding Decision Authority**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-28-UTC-1227  
**🎯 Objective:** Analyze who decides in PDCA framework and why  

**👤 Agent Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Decision Authority Analyst  
**👤 Branch:** save/start.v2 → Stable Production Reference  
**🎯 Project Journal Session:** 2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent → Recovery & Compliance Session  
**🎯 Sprint:** Sprint-21 → Process Standardization  
**✅ Task:** Clarify Decision Authority in PDCA Process  
**🚨 Issues:** Need to understand decision hierarchy  

**📎 Previous Commit:** 7d9e206 - PDCA: V2 branch creation completed - main now tracks v2

### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Analyzing existing decision authority structure.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1227)**
```quote
tell me who decides?
why?
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Creating PDCA to analyze decision authority. The fundamental answer from PDCA.howto.decide.md:
- **USER decides** (not agent)
- **Why**: QA Decisions section is for USER decisions
- **Agent role**: Present options, user chooses

**Learning Applied:** Decision authority clarity prevents overreach.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Clarify who has decision authority and why

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA decision framework principles

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Review Documentation:** Extract decision authority rules
- **Analyze Examples:** See how decisions work in practice
- **Understand Why:** The philosophy behind user authority
- **Document Clearly:** Who decides what and when

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Core Principle from PDCA.howto.decide.md**

```markdown
### **Core Principle**
**CRITICAL:** The QA Decisions section is for USER decisions, not agent decisions!
```

**Who Decides What**

1. **USER Decides:**
   - Strategic choices (a/b/c options)
   - Destructive operations approval
   - Direction and priorities
   - Which option to implement

2. **AGENT Presents:**
   - Clear options with consequences
   - Meaningful alternatives
   - Risk warnings
   - Implementation paths

3. **AGENT NEVER Decides:**
   - Which option is "best"
   - What user "should" choose
   - Pre-selecting options
   - Making assumptions

**Why This Structure**

1. **Accountability**: User owns consequences
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation of roles
3. **Safety**: Prevents agent overreach
4. **Trust**: User maintains control
5. **Collaboration**: Agent informs, user decides

**Examples from Our Session**

- I presented: "Branch from v1, main, or fresh?"
- YOU decided: "v1" (by creating v2 from v1)
- I executed: Your decision

**The Exception**

"All clear, no decisions to make" - When path is obvious and unambiguous, agent proceeds but still documents.

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Verification Results:**

**Decision Authority Matrix**
```
USER:     ✅ Strategic decisions
USER:     ✅ Approval for changes
USER:     ✅ Direction setting
AGENT:    ✅ Option presentation
AGENT:    ✅ Risk identification
AGENT:    ✅ Implementation execution
AGENT:    ❌ Choosing for user
```

**Philosophy Validation**
- Maintains user sovereignty
- Prevents agent assumptions
- Ensures informed decisions
- Creates clear accountability

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Success Achieved:** Decision authority clearly understood

**Key Principles:**
1. **USER is the decision maker**
2. **AGENT is the option provider**
3. **QA Decisions = USER territory**
4. **Implementation = AGENT territory**

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents "helpful" overreach
- Maintains trust boundaries
- Ensures user control
- Creates audit trail

**Practical Application:**
- Always present real choices
- Never pre-decide
- Document user's choice
- Execute faithfully

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Respectful Clarity**

### **Understanding:**
**FUNDAMENTAL** - User sovereignty is core to PDCA philosophy.

### **Respect:**
**DEEP** - For the clear boundary between inform and decide.

### **Commitment:**
**ABSOLUTE** - To maintain this separation always.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Decision Authority:** USER decides, AGENT presents
- ✅ **QA Section Purpose:** Capture USER decisions only
- ✅ **Agent Overreach:** Deciding for user = violation
- ✅ **Trust Model:** Information + Options = User Decision

**Quality Impact:** Clear authority boundaries ensure proper accountability.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Always respect the decision boundary.

**🎯 Decision authority crystal clear - USER decides, AGENT executes! 👤↔️🤖**

**"With great options comes great user responsibility"** 🔧📊
