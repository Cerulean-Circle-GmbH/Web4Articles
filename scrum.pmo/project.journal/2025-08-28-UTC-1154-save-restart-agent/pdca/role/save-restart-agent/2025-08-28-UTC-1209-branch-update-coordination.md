### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1209)**
```quote
give me a list of unmerged branches from today, that need the updates from this branch. give me a list with potential candidates in the pdca, that habe md task elements and i can check them to update them.
weh i checked them,

cherry pick the newest changes from this branch and fast forward the branch to reflect this branche state. create the pdca and ask me for selecting the branches. wen i checked them i will prompt "done" and you can read it and know which. update scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md with this sopisticated option in special cases like this.
```

### **My Answer**
Created branch selection checklist above. When you check the branches and respond "done", I will cherry-pick the save/start.v1 changes to your selected branches. This sophisticated decision method will be documented in PDCA.howto.decide.md.

**Learning Applied:** Interactive branch selection with markdown checkboxes enables precise control over multi-branch updates.

## **üìã PLAN**

### **Update Strategy**
1. **Present branch options** with checkboxes
2. **Wait for user selection** via "done" prompt
3. **Cherry-pick commits** to selected branches
4. **Fast-forward** where possible
5. **Document process** in howto.decide.md

### **Commits to Cherry-pick**
```bash
f0e428d Process: PDCA prompt compliance check
cf6053a DevOps: Non-interactive script standards
4620446 Enhancement: Dual links standardization
559b34e Process: Remove qa-feedback-log.md
```

When ready, type "done" and I will:
1. Read this PDCA to see your selections
2. Cherry-pick the commits to each selected branch
3. Report the results
4. Update PDCA.howto.decide.md with this method

### **Cherry-pick Command Template**
```bash
