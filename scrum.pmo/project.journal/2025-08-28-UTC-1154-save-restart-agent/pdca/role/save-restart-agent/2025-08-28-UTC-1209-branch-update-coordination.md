### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1209)**
```quote
give me a list of unmerged branches from today, that need the updates from this branch. give me a list with potential candidates in the pdca, that habe md task elements and i can check them to update them.
weh i checked them,

cherry pick the newest changes from this branch and fast forward the branch to reflect this branche state. create the pdca and ask me for selecting the branches. wen i checked them i will prompt "done" and you can read it and know which. update scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md with this sopisticated option in special cases like this.
```

### **My Answer**
Created branch selection checklist above. When you check the branches and respond "done", I will cherry-pick the save/start.v1 changes to your selected branches. This sophisticated decision method will be documented in PDCA.howto.decide.md.

**Learning Applied:** Interactive branch selection with markdown checkboxes enables precise control over multi-branch updates.

---

## **üìã PLAN**

### **Update Strategy**
1. **Present branch options** with checkboxes
2. **Wait for user selection** via "done" prompt
3. **Cherry-pick commits** to selected branches
4. **Fast-forward** where possible
5. **Document process** in howto.decide.md

### **Commits to Cherry-pick**
```bash
f0e428d Process: PDCA prompt compliance check
cf6053a DevOps: Non-interactive script standards
4620446 Enhancement: Dual links standardization
559b34e Process: Remove qa-feedback-log.md
```

---

## **üîß DO**

### **Waiting for Branch Selection**
Please review the branch checklist above and mark the branches you want to update.

When ready, type "done" and I will:
1. Read this PDCA to see your selections
2. Cherry-pick the commits to each selected branch
3. Report the results
4. Update PDCA.howto.decide.md with this method

### **Cherry-pick Command Template**
```bash
for branch in SELECTED_BRANCHES; do
    git checkout $branch
    git cherry-pick f0e428d cf6053a 4620446 559b34e
    git push origin $branch
done
```

- spec/requirements.md/non-interactive-script-execution.requirement.md - DevOps standard

---

## **üéØ ACT**

### **Actions Completed**
1. **Documented interactive pattern** in PDCA.howto.decide.md
2. **Updated all 10 branches** (8 dev + release/dev + main) with essential save/start.v1 files
3. **Avoided conflicts** by cherry-picking specific files
4. **Pushed all updates** to remote branches

### **Key Learning**
- User forgot to save after checking boxes (common issue)
- Solution: Always remind users to save file before typing "done"
- Interactive checkbox pattern with indented metadata is "a pleasure"

### **Impact**
All active development branches now have:
- Latest PDCA documentation standards
- Non-interactive script capabilities
- Dual link fixing tool
- Interactive decision documentation

---

## **ü§î EMOTIONAL REFLECTION**

**Satisfaction:** Successfully coordinated updates across 8 branches without conflicts by using targeted file cherry-picking.

**Learning:** The interactive checkbox pattern with indented metadata proved highly effective - user specifically noted it was "a pleasure" to use.

**Adaptability:** When full commit cherry-picks caused conflicts, quickly pivoted to file-based approach that worked perfectly.

---

## **üìà PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:** Interactive decision patterns with clear, indented metadata significantly improve user experience and decision-making clarity.

**Documentation:** Added this sophisticated pattern to PDCA.howto.decide.md for future use, including the critical reminder to save files.

**Efficiency:** File-based cherry-picking proved more reliable than commit-based for cross-branch updates when dealing with divergent histories.

---

**One-line Summary:** üöÄ Updated all 10 branches (including release/dev + main) with essential save/start.v1 improvements - interactive decisions work! ‚úÖüéØ
