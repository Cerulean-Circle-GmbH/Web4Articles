### **QA Decisions**
- [x] Fixed 03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md link
- [x] Fixed template links (04, 05, 06)
- [x] All pdca.process.improvements links now functional

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-1202)**
```quote
scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/pdca.process.improvements/03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md does not resolve... double check.
```

### **My Answer**
You're right! I missed the process and templates directories. Cherry-picked both from release/dev. Now all links including 03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md resolve correctly. Verified the traceability enhancement document loads properly.

**Learning Applied:** Always verify ALL symbolic links after cherry-picking, not just the primary ones checked.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

### **Fix Strategy**
1. **Check broken link** - 03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md
2. **Find target location** - scrum.pmo/process directory
3. **Cherry-pick process/** - Get missing directory
4. **Check other links** - Templates might also be missing
5. **Cherry-pick templates/** - Complete the fix

### **Expected Outcomes**
- All symbolic links in pdca.process.improvements functional
- Process directory available
- Templates directory available
- Complete link resolution achieved

---

## **🔧 DO**

### **1. Broken Link Analysis**
```bash
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/pdca.process.improvements/03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md
# -> ../../../process/pdca-traceability-enhancement.md
```

### **2. Target Search**
```bash
git ls-tree -r origin/release/dev | grep -E "process.*pdca-traceability"
# Found: scrum.pmo/process/pdca-traceability-enhancement.md
```

### **3. Process Directory Cherry-pick**
```bash
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/process/
```

### **4. Templates Directory Cherry-pick**
```bash
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/templates/
```
Added:
- pdca.standard.template.md
- pdca.enhanced.template.md
- pdca.role-transition.template.md
- branch-overview.template.md
- project-journal-session.template.md
- project.state.template.md

### **5. Verification**
- 03-pdca-traceability-enhancement.md ✅ Shows recovery protocol
- 04-pdca-standard-template.md ✅ Shows PDCA template
- All other links verified functional
