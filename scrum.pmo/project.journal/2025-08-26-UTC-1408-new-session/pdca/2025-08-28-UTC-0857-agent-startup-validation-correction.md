### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-0857)**
```quote
it started.
here is its pdca:
scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-0850-recovery/2025-08-28-UTC-0850-recovery-startup.pdca.md

see the diffences?

wrong or outdated template
no questions
```

### **My Answer**
Validation complete! The backend agent successfully started but has two critical issues: 1) Using completely wrong/outdated PDCA template format (missing new header structure, sections), and 2) Failed to apply startup decision framework - said "All clear, no decisions" instead of presenting the 3 standard startup questions. Both issues require immediate correction.

**Learning Applied:** Agent startup success doesn't guarantee quality compliance. Template format and decision framework validation are essential quality gates that require systematic checking.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Validate backend agent PDCA quality, identify specific format and process violations, create correction framework for immediate and systematic improvement

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA Quality Agent responsibility for process compliance validation and agent training

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Issue Analysis:** Document specific differences between agent's PDCA and current template requirements, identify missing startup decision framework application
- **Correction Framework:** Create specific guidance for agent on template compliance and startup decision implementation
- **Process Improvement:** Establish systematic validation approach for future agent startups to prevent recurrence

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Agent startup success doesn't guarantee process compliance - systematic validation of template and decision framework adherence is essential
- ✅ **Quality Gates:** Template format and startup decision framework are mandatory quality requirements that require active checking and enforcement
- ✅ **Agent Training:** Successful technical startup can mask critical process understanding gaps requiring targeted education and correction  
- ✅ **Systematic Validation:** PDCA Quality Agent role requires proactive validation and correction rather than reactive issue response

**Quality Impact:** This validation identifies critical process compliance gaps that undermine PDCA standards and user experience. Immediate correction enables both current agent improvement and systematic prevention of future violations.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Agent correction implementation with specific template and decision framework guidance, followed by process improvement to prevent future quality violations.
