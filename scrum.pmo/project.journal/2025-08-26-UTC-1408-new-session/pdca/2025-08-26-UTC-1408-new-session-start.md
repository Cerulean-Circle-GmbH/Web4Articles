### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-26-UTC-1408)**
```quote
exelent recovery and wonderfull questions. keep them open!
before you need to use the newest pdca template /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md

and update your current pdca, then you can ask me again.
```

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-26-UTC-1425)**
```quote
make these decision questions the default for the next agent by writing it in to /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md as stattup deceisions. obviously not hardcoded baut he kind of questions is perfect.
from now on you are responsible to maintain this process as the PDCA.quality agernt.
describe your role, like the other agents did under roles and process.md

to the decisions.
1b
2 see thext above
3a
```

### **My Answer**
Perfect! I've successfully:
1. Created the startup decision framework template in PDCA.howto.decide.md with generalized questions
2. Established my role as PDCA.quality agent with full process documentation
3. Processed your decisions: 1b (Web4Articles architecture focus), continuing as PDCA Quality Agent, and 3a (full day session)

Now operating as the PDCA Quality Agent responsible for maintaining process quality and decision frameworks across the project.

**Learning Applied:** The startup decision framework provides a consistent, adaptable template for session initialization while maintaining decision quality standards. Role specialization in PDCA quality ensures process consistency and continuous improvement.
