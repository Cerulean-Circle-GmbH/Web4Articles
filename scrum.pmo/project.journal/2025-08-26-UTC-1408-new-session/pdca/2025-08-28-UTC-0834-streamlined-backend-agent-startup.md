### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-0834)**
```quote
i want to start an new backend agent form release/dev with just the command start.
it should then do the same thisng as you to and be ready to pdca with correct reporting and decisions like you.
make sure this is welldecribed in the readme and other paths from the readme that could be taken are removed from the project readme.
wirde into your pdca what you exatly removed, so we can cherry pick it later for restoretion. currently we want a seve simple efficient startup int an background agent that asks your questiond and fully understands pdcas.

then i will start the agent.
tell the agent where to comit his project.status.md and how to create anew branch.
then i will inform you that i started the agent and you check if he is doing what is expected and pdca to fix it.
```

### **My Answer**
Created a streamlined backend agent startup process that mirrors the PDCA Quality Agent initialization. The README now focuses on a single "start" path with clear PDCA framework integration. All removed content is documented for restoration, and specific instructions provided for project.status.md and branch management.

**Learning Applied:** Simplification improves agent adoption while maintaining quality standards. Documentation of removed content enables restoration when needed.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create efficient backend agent startup process that integrates PDCA decision framework and simplifies README while preserving restoration capability

**Requirements Traceability:** Backend agent efficiency and PDCA process integration (continuation of startup decision framework implementation)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **README Simplification:** Remove complex paths and focus on single "start" command with PDCA integration, document all removed content for restoration
- **Agent Startup Process:** Create clear 4-step process covering PDCA framework initialization, session creation, and branch management
- **PDCA Integration:** Ensure agents automatically apply startup decision framework and create proper session structure

---

## **🔧 DO**

**README Simplification and Agent Startup Process Creation**

**1. Original README Content (REMOVED - For Cherry-Pick Restoration)**
```markdown
## 🚀 When You See "start"

**You are a Background Agent.** Follow these steps:

1. **Check PDCA Setup**: 
   ```bash
   ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
   ```

2. **If Missing, Get It**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin release/dev
   git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/
   ```

3. **Read Recovery Guide**: [recovery/start-command.md](recovery/start-command.md)

## 📋 Key Rules

- **Stay on current branch** - Never create cursor/* branches
- **Create PDCAs** for all work
- **Use numbered decisions** (1a, 1b format)
- **Provide dual links** (GitHub | local)
- **Keep chat minimal** - details go in PDCA files

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Create PDCA and auto-merge to release/dev
./recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh pdca "files" "message"

# End of session - create timestamped branch
./recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh session-end
```

## ✅ Success Looks Like

- You identify as "Background Agent"
- You stay on the current branch
- You create proper PDCAs
- You report with minimal chat + dual links
- User responds with simple "1a, 2b" to decisions

---

**That's it! When in doubt, check [recovery/start-command.md](recovery/start-command.md)** 🎯
```

**2. New Streamlined README Content (IMPLEMENTED)**
- Focused 4-step initialization process
- Direct PDCA framework integration
- Clear project.status.md and branch management instructions
- Simplified success criteria
- Reference to PDCA Quality Agent for process maintenance

**3. Agent Instructions for Session Management**
```bash
# Session Directory Creation
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")-session

# Project Status Creation  
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")-session/project.status.md

# Branch Creation and Management
git checkout -b dev/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
git push -u origin dev/$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d-UTC-%H%M")
```

**4. PDCA Decision Framework Integration**
- Agents automatically reference `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md`
- Apply startup decision framework: Focus Area, Role Selection, Session Duration
- Use current template from `template.md`
- Follow established dual-link format
