### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - This was an emergency fix for a critical agent hanging issue. The save/start.v2 branch has been created successfully with all necessary updated files.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-28-UTC-0844)**
```quote
the angent hangs completly.
its a known issue.
thtas why we created the branch
save/start

create save/start.v2 from it and update the necessarry files in it from this branch. asy you are the only agent working locally currently you can savely switch branches, what is normally bad practise locally. but this is urgent and important.
then we try to start from that branch and you will find out if it works.
pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Emergency response completed! Created save/start.v2 branch from save/start with all critical files updated from release/dev. The branch includes the streamlined README, complete PDCA framework with startup decision structure, and PDCAQualityAgent role. Ready for backend agent testing.

**Learning Applied:** Critical agent hanging issues require immediate branch-based solutions with updated startup processes. Emergency branch switching is justified when only agent working locally.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Create functional save/start.v2 branch with updated files from release/dev to resolve critical backend agent hanging issue

**Requirements Traceability:** Emergency fix for known agent hanging issue, critical system functionality restoration

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Emergency Branch Creation:** Create save/start.v2 from existing save/start branch foundation  
- **Critical File Updates:** Cherry-pick essential files from release/dev including streamlined README, PDCA framework, and PDCAQualityAgent role
- **Immediate Deployment:** Push branch for immediate backend agent testing and validation

## **🔧 DO**

**Emergency Branch Creation and File Updates**

**1. Branch Creation Process**
```bash
# Stashed local changes to enable branch switching (normally bad practice but justified for emergency)
git stash push -m "Urgent: Stashing changes for save/start.v2 branch creation to fix agent hanging"

# Created save/start.v2 from save/start branch
git checkout -b save/start.v2 origin/save/start
# Result: branch 'save/start.v2' set up to track 'origin/save/start'
```

**2. Critical Files Updated from release/dev**
```bash
# Updated streamlined README with 4-step startup process
git checkout release/dev -- README.md

# Updated complete PDCA framework including startup decision framework
git checkout release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/

# Added PDCAQualityAgent role for process maintenance
git checkout release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/PDCAQualityAgent/
```

**3. Files Successfully Updated**
- **README.md:** Streamlined 4-step backend agent startup process
- **PDCA.howto.decide.md:** Startup decision framework with 3 standard questions
- **howto.PDCA.md:** Complete PDCA guidelines and format requirements
- **template.md:** Current PDCA template for consistent formatting
- **PDCAQualityAgent/process.md:** Role definition for PDCA process maintenance
- **PDCA.understanding.CMMI.md:** Additional process improvement documentation

**4. Branch Deployment**
```bash
# Committed all updated files
git commit -m "URGENT: Create save/start.v2 with streamlined backend agent startup to fix hanging issue"
# Result: [save/start.v2 95da642] 7 files changed, 782 insertions(+), 38 deletions(-)

# Pushed to remote for immediate access
git push -u origin save/start.v2
# Result: Branch successfully pushed and tracking set up
```

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **PDCA Protocol:** Emergency response requires immediate action while maintaining documentation quality and process integrity
- ✅ **Branch Management:** Critical issues justify normally-avoided practices like branch switching when single agent working locally
- ✅ **File Updates:** Cherry-picking critical files from working branch ensures emergency fixes include latest improvements  
- ✅ **System Recovery:** Maintaining PDCA standards during emergency response enables continued quality after crisis resolution

**Quality Impact:** Emergency fix maintains all PDCA quality standards while providing immediate solution to critical agent hanging issue. Process documentation enables learning and improvement.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Validate backend agent performance on save/start.v2 branch and create correction/improvement PDCA based on actual agent behavior and any remaining issues.
