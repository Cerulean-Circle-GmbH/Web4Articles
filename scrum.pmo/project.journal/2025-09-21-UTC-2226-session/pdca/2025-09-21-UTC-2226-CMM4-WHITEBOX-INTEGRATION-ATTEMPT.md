### **QA Decisions - CMM4 INTEGRATION REQUIRED**
- [x] **Reading vs Integration Gap:** Read CMM4 documentation but didn't integrate whitebox analysis capability
- [x] **Capability Levels:** Seeing → Reading → Embracing → Understanding → Integrating
- [x] **System Reset Required:** Reverted broken changes to start with clean understanding
- [x] **Whitebox Analysis Needed:** Must systematically understand working auto-discovery before changes

### **TRON CMM4 Integration Challenge**
```quote
absolutely. thats what howto cmm taught you. but there is a difference between seeing reading embracing understanding and integrating a capability. so try again
pdca
```

### **My Response - CMM4 INTEGRATION ATTEMPT**
Acknowledged difference between reading and integrating CMM4 capability. Reset broken changes and attempting proper CMM4 whitebox analysis. Must systematically understand working auto-discovery in Unit and Web4TSComponent before making any changes.

**Learning Applied:** CMM4 whitebox analysis requires systematic understanding, not assumptions. Integration requires running systems multiple times to understand them completely.

## **📋 PLAN - CMM4 WHITEBOX INTEGRATION FOR AUTO-DISCOVERY**

**Objective:** Actually integrate CMM4 whitebox analysis capability to understand auto-discovery system

**CMM4 Integration Strategy:**
- **Run System Multiple Times**: Test auto-discovery systematically with different components
- **Whitebox Understanding**: Analyze HOW it works, not assume how it should work
- **System Comprehension**: Understand working architecture before making changes
- **Capability Integration**: Apply CMM4 principles to achieve real understanding

---

## **🔧 DO - CMM4 WHITEBOX ANALYSIS INTEGRATION**

**Phase 1: Systematic Auto-Discovery Testing (CMM4 Approach)**

**1. Test Auto-Discovery with Working Components**
```bash
# Test 1: Web4TSComponent auto-discovery (baseline)
cd /workspace/components/Web4TSComponent/0.3.0.9
./web4tscomponent help
→ Shows Web4TSComponent methods ✅

# Test 2: Unit context loading and method execution
./web4tscomponent on Unit 0.3.0.5 info
→ Executes Web4TSComponent info method with Unit context ✅

# Test 3: Check if Unit methods are supposed to be auto-discovered
# WHITEBOX QUESTION: Does Unit have its own CLI for Unit methods?
```

**2. Understand Unit CLI Architecture**
```bash
# Check if Unit has its own CLI
ls /workspace/components/Unit/0.3.0.5/ | grep -i cli
→ Investigation needed: How are Unit methods supposed to be accessed?

# WHITEBOX ANALYSIS: 
# - Are Unit methods accessed through Unit's own CLI?
# - Or through Web4TSComponent operating on Unit context?
# - What's the actual design pattern?
```

**Phase 2: SessionSummary Auto-Discovery Analysis**

**3. SessionSummary Method Access Pattern Investigation**
```bash
# Check SessionSummary CLI existence and functionality
ls /workspace/components/SessionSummary/0.3.0.9/ | grep -i cli
→ Investigation: How should SessionSummary methods be accessed?

# Test direct method functionality (already proven working)
# fixUTCNaming works when called directly ✅

# WHITEBOX QUESTION: Why isn't it auto-discovered?
# - Missing CLI setup?
# - Wrong component architecture?
# - Method annotation issues?
```

**Phase 3: CMM4 System Understanding**

**4. Architecture Pattern Recognition**
```
CMM4 WHITEBOX ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
1. How do Unit methods get discovered and executed?
2. What's the difference between Unit and SessionSummary architecture?
3. Why does fixUTCNaming work directly but not through auto-discovery?
4. What's the proper pattern for component method access?

GOAL: Understand the system as whitebox before making changes
```

**5. Working System Analysis**
```
KNOWN WORKING:
✅ Web4TSComponent auto-discovery shows Web4TSComponent methods
✅ Web4TSComponent methods can operate on any component context (via 'on')
✅ fixUTCNaming method works when called directly
✅ Unit context loading works (can execute Web4TSComponent methods on Unit)

UNKNOWN: How Unit-specific methods are supposed to be accessed
INVESTIGATION NEEDED: Proper architecture pattern for component method access
```

```

**System Reset Status (✅ COMPLETED)**
```
✅ Broken Changes Reverted: Web4TSComponent restored to clean state
✅ Hallucinated Fixes Removed: Universal auto-discovery assumptions eliminated
✅ Clean Starting Point: Ready for proper CMM4 whitebox analysis
✅ Focus Restored: Back to goal #4 - fix UTC naming through proper auto-discovery
```

**CMM4 Analysis Required (📋 SYSTEMATIC)**
```
📋 Test Working Systems: Understand how Unit and Web4TSComponent auto-discovery actually works
📋 Compare Architectures: SessionSummary vs Unit vs Web4TSComponent patterns
📋 Identify Differences: Why fixUTCNaming doesn't auto-discover when others do
📋 Proper Integration: Apply understanding to enable SessionSummary auto-discovery
```

**Goal Clarification (🎯 REFOCUSED)**
```
🎯 Primary Goal: Fix UTC naming for this session through auto-discovery
🎯 Method Exists: fixUTCNaming implemented and proven working
🎯 Issue: Auto-discovery not working for SessionSummary methods
🎯 Approach: CMM4 whitebox analysis of working systems first
```
