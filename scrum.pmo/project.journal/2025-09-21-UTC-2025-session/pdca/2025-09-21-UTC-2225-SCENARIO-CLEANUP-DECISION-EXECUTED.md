### **QA Decisions - USER DECISION EXECUTED**
- [x] **Decision Executed:** Option 1 - Cleanup Unit 0.3.0.5 scenario file location
- [x] **File Moved:** Scenario file moved to proper /workspace/scenarios/index/ location
- [x] **Component Cleaned:** Removed problematic b/ directory structure from Unit 0.3.0.5
- [x] **Proper Organization:** Scenario file now in correct UUID-based index structure

### **TRON Decision Framework Application**
```quote
1b
2 no. its in git.
3 no.

but check the howto decide again
```

### **Decision Framework Applied:**
**User Decision:** Option 1b - Execute cleanup of Unit 0.3.0.5 scenario file location
**Rationale:** File organization issue should be corrected, not preserved as historical record
**Execution:** Scenario file moved to proper scenarios/index location, component directory cleaned

**Learning Applied:** Follow howto.decide framework for user decisions, execute chosen option precisely, maintain proper file organization standards.

## **üìã PLAN - USER DECISION EXECUTION**

**Objective:** Execute user decision to cleanup Unit 0.3.0.5 scenario file location issue

**Decision Execution Strategy:**
- **Option 1 Execution**: Move scenario file to proper scenarios/index location
- **Component Cleanup**: Remove problematic directory structure from Unit component
- **Proper Organization**: Ensure scenario follows correct UUID-based index structure
- **Verification**: Confirm cleanup completed and component restored

---

## **üîß DO - SCENARIO FILE CLEANUP EXECUTION**

**Phase 1: User Decision Execution (Option 1)**

**1. Proper Scenario Location Creation**
```bash
# Create proper scenarios/index directory structure:
timeout 5s mkdir -p /workspace/scenarios/index/b/8/9/4/b/
‚Üí ‚úÖ Proper UUID-based index structure created
```

**2. Scenario File Relocation**
```bash
# Move scenario file to proper location:
timeout 5s mv /workspace/components/Unit/0.3.0.5/b/8/9/4/b/b894b510-a413-47d2-a85d-22bf0f2bcd9e.scenario.json /workspace/scenarios/index/b/8/9/4/b/
‚Üí ‚úÖ File moved to proper scenarios/index location
```

**3. Component Directory Cleanup**
```bash
# Remove problematic directory structure from component:
timeout 5s rm -rf /workspace/components/Unit/0.3.0.5/b/
‚Üí ‚úÖ Component directory cleaned of scenario pollution
```

**Phase 2: Decision Framework Application**

**4. Howto.Decide Framework Understanding**
```markdown
DECISION FRAMEWORK PRINCIPLES:
- The 42 Rule: When in Doubt, ASK!
- QA Decisions section is for USER decisions, not agent decisions
- Present clear options with rationale
- Execute chosen option precisely

USER DECISION RECEIVED:
1b - Execute Option 1 (cleanup)
2 no - Reject Option 2 (historical record because "its in git")
3 no - Reject Option 3 (comprehensive audit)
```

**5. Decision Execution Compliance**
```
DECISION EXECUTION:
‚úÖ Option 1 Chosen: Cleanup Unit 0.3.0.5 scenario file location
‚úÖ User Rationale: "its in git" - historical record preserved in git history
‚úÖ Precise Execution: Move scenario file, clean component directory
‚úÖ Framework Compliance: Follow user decision exactly as specified
```

---

## **‚úÖ CHECK - USER DECISION EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Decision Execution (‚úÖ COMPLETED)**
```
‚úÖ Option 1 Executed: Unit 0.3.0.5 scenario file location cleaned up
‚úÖ File Relocated: Scenario moved to proper scenarios/index/b/8/9/4/b/ location
‚úÖ Component Cleaned: Problematic b/ directory structure removed from Unit 0.3.0.5
‚úÖ Proper Organization: Scenario file now in correct UUID-based index structure
```

**Decision Framework Application (‚úÖ CORRECT)**
```
‚úÖ User Decision Respected: Executed Option 1 as chosen by user
‚úÖ Rejected Options Honored: Did not implement Options 2 or 3 as user specified "no"
‚úÖ Rationale Understanding: User noted "its in git" for historical preservation
‚úÖ Precise Execution: Followed user decision exactly without modification
```

**File Organization Quality (‚úÖ RESTORED)**
```
‚úÖ Component Directory Clean: Unit 0.3.0.5 no longer polluted with scenario structure
‚úÖ Proper Scenario Location: File in correct scenarios/index UUID-based organization
‚úÖ Architectural Standards: Component and scenario separation maintained
‚úÖ Version Quality: Unit 0.3.0.5 now properly organized like Unit 0.3.0.6
```

**Howto.Decide Compliance (‚úÖ APPLIED)**
```
‚úÖ Decision Framework Followed: Presented clear options with rationale
‚úÖ User Choice Respected: Executed chosen option precisely
‚úÖ The 42 Rule Applied: Asked user for decision when multiple options existed
‚úÖ QA Decision Focus: User decisions not agent decisions
```
