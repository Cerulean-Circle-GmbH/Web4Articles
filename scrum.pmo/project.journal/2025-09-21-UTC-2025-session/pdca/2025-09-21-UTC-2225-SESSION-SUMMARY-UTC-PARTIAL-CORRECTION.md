### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **SessionSummary Partial Fix:** Extracts correct UTC from git (2226) but doesn't fix session naming (2225)
- [x] **Link Paths Still Wrong:** § and GitHub links still use incorrect 2225 session directory
- [x] **Mixed Correction:** UTC Time column correct, but session title and paths incorrect
- [x] **Manual Correction Needed:** SessionSummary doesn't automatically rename session directory

### **TRON UTC Correction Question**
```quote
did the session summary component correc it automatically?
```

### **Analysis - PARTIAL CORRECTION ONLY**
SessionSummary component partially corrected UTC issue - extracts correct git commit UTC (2226) for display but doesn't automatically rename session directory or fix link paths. Still shows wrong session title (2225) and uses incorrect paths in links.

**Answer:** **Partial correction only** - UTC time extracted correctly from git, but session naming and link paths not automatically corrected.

## **🔧 DO - SESSIONSUM UTC CORRECTION ANALYSIS**

**SessionSummary Behavior Analysis:**
```
WHAT IT CORRECTED:
✅ UTC Time Column: Shows 2025-09-21-UTC-2025 (correct from git commit)
✅ Git SHA Reference: Properly links to cb89c303 commit

WHAT IT DIDN'T CORRECT:
❌ Session Title: Still shows "2025-09-21-UTC-2225-session"
❌ Session Path: Still shows wrong session directory path
❌ Link Paths: § and GitHub links still use 2225 session directory
❌ Session Directory: Physical directory name not renamed
```

**Partial Correction Impact:**
- **Data Accuracy**: Git commit UTC correctly extracted and displayed
- **Link Functionality**: Links still broken due to wrong session directory paths
- **Naming Consistency**: Mixed correction creates confusion
- **Manual Fix Required**: Session directory and link paths need manual correction

## **✅ CHECK - PARTIAL CORRECTION CONFIRMED**

**SessionSummary UTC Behavior (✅ ANALYZED)**
```
✅ Git UTC Extraction: Correctly extracts 2026 from git commit
❌ Session Naming: Doesn't rename session directory automatically  
❌ Link Path Updates: Doesn't update § and GitHub link paths
✅ Commit Reference: Properly references git SHA and UTC time
```

**Answer:** SessionSummary component provides **partial correction only** - extracts correct UTC from git but doesn't automatically fix session naming or link paths.
