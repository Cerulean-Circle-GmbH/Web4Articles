### **My Answer**
Initializing Web4Articles DAPP session following the README startup instructions. I've successfully:
1. Verified PDCA framework documentation exists
2. Created session directory with UTC timestamp
3. Established dev branch for isolated development
4. Prepared startup decision framework for work direction

**Learning Applied:** Following structured startup process ensures proper project management and clear user alignment from session beginning.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Establish clear work direction for Web4Articles DAPP development session through structured decision-making process

**Requirements Traceability:** README.md startup instructions and PDCA framework compliance

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Session Setup:** Create proper directory structure and git branch for isolated development work
- **Decision Framework:** Present three standard startup decisions for user alignment on focus, role, and duration
- **Process Compliance:** Follow PDCA template v3.0 requirements with proper dual links and UTC timestamps

## **🔧 DO**

**Session Initialization Actions**

**1. PDCA Framework Verification**
```bash
# Verified PDCA documentation exists
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md
```

**2. Session Directory Creation**
```bash
# Created timestamped session directory
mkdir -p scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-05-UTC-1149-session
echo "# Project Status - $(date -u)" > scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-05-UTC-1149-session/project.status.md
