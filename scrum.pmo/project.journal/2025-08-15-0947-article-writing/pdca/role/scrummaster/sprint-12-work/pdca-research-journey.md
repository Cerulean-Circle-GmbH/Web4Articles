# PDCA - Research TSRanger Journey: From Chaos to UCP Understanding

## Plan
- **Objective:** Research complete TSRanger journey for enhanced article context
- **Scope:** From initial idea through testing struggles to UCP discovery
- **User Directive:** 
  > "write a list of tasks how you got vorm chaos repo to ucp like tsranger. start to revier the journey from tsranger idea over the pdcas, havin running code quickly, having tests fast, the trouble with testing and hanging scripts, making tsranger havin a test mode, the success from that and the key streams for testing and then loosing yourself in refactoringâ€¦ giving up and think about a new v2 but how, we only have one src dir, the troble that there was only one test folder, the refactoring for a more flexible journey, the lack of knowledge that UCP existed and what it real means"
- **Approach:** Multiple PDCA cycles building comprehensive context

## Do
### Initial Research Findings

1. **Sprint 2 - TSRanger Birth**
   - Task 1.2: Created initial TSRanger TUI
   - Started with `src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts`
   - Quick running code: `node --loader ts-node/esm src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts`
   - Task 1.7: Early refactoring to separate classes

2. **Testing Challenges Discovered**
   - Task 7.2: Need for "scripted non-interactive" mode
   - Environment variables affecting tests: `COLUMNS`, `LINES`, `PS1`
   - Task 7.3: Introduction of "scenario" configurations
   - `TSRANGER_TEST_MODE` environment variable created

3. **Sprint 7 - The v2.5 Refactoring**
   - Task 2.1: Architect defined new structure
   - Introduced versioned folders: `components/TSRanger/v2.5/`
   - Separated IO for deterministic testing
   - Created layers: io, layer2, layer4, layer5

## Check
- Found evidence of testing struggles requiring test mode
- Discovered v2.5 as response to single src/test limitation
- Need to find more about:
  - Specific hanging script issues
  - The "giving up" moment
  - When UCP understanding emerged
  - Connection to component architecture

## Act
- Continue researching Sprint 3-6 for missing pieces
- Look for PDCAs documenting testing failures
- Search for first UCP mentions
- Create timeline of key decisions
