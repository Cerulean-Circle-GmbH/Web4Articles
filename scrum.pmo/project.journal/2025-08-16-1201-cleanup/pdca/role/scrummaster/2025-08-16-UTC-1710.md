# üìã PDCA Cycle: Commit AND Push Workflow - 2025-08-16-UTC-1710

## üìã Summary
Critical reminder about the importance of pushing commits to make work visible on GitHub. Commits without push = invisible work!

---

## üìä Plan

### Issue Identified
> "againt the link does not exist.
> https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup/active-agents.md
> 
> do you write pdcas and commit and push?"

### Root Cause
I was committing changes but NOT pushing them to GitHub, making all the links invalid.

### Impact
- Users can't access the documented work
- Links appear broken
- Collaboration is hindered
- Work appears incomplete

---

## üöÄ Do

### 1. Immediate Fix ‚úÖ
```bash
git push origin release/dev
# Pushed 14 files, 4.46 KiB
```

### 2. Workflow Analysis ‚úÖ
Current workflow:
1. ‚úÖ Create/edit files
2. ‚úÖ Write PDCAs
3. ‚úÖ Commit with messages
4. ‚ùå Push (was missing!)

### 3. New Workflow Rule ‚úÖ
**ALWAYS**: Edit ‚Üí PDCA ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí **PUSH**

---

## ‚úÖ Check

### Your Feedback
> "do you write pdcas and commit and push?"

**Answer**: 
- PDCAs: YES ‚úÖ
- Commit: YES ‚úÖ  
- Push: NO ‚ùå (now fixed!)

### Verification
The link now works after pushing:
[GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup/active-agents.md) [./scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup/active-agents.md](file:///workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup/active-agents.md)

## üîÑ Act

### New Personal Workflow
```bash
# After EVERY significant change:
git add -A
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git push origin release/dev  # DON'T FORGET THIS!
```

### Mental Checklist
Before saying "I've done X":
1. Is it committed?
2. **IS IT PUSHED?** ‚Üê New critical step
3. Do the GitHub links work?

### Automation Consideration
Consider creating a wrapper script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# commit-and-push.sh
git add -A
git commit -m "$1"
git push origin release/dev
echo "‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub!"
```

### Lesson Learned
**Unpushed commits = Invisible work!**

GitHub links only work after push. This is especially critical when working as a background agent where the user relies on GitHub links for verification.
