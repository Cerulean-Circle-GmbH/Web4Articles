**PDCAs Moved to Previous Session:**
- All `pdca-*.md` files → `/workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-15-0947-article-writing/pdca/role/scrummaster/sprint-12-work/`
- Preserved original timestamps as requested

**Sprint Structure Cleaned:**
- [Consolidated planning.md](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-12/planning.md)
- Removed redundant: `planning-article-series.md`, `planning.input.md`
- Kept: `planning.md`, `tasks/` directory

---

## 🎯 Plan

### Objectives
1. Move articles to `/workspace/articles/medium.com/`
2. Move PDCAs to journal session (preserve timestamps)
3. Clean sprint folder to standard structure
4. Update all references
5. Document for future automation

### Context
- **Your Wisdom**: 
  > "the sprint 12 file structure totally went astray"
  > "1. yes do a new session 2. keep original timestamps 3. focus is highest prio. cleanup has to always happen at eod"

## 🚀 Do

### Actions Executed

1. **Created Cleanup Session**
   ```bash
   /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup/
   ```

2. **Moved Articles with Better Names**
   ```bash
   git mv article-v4-developer-struggles.md → 01-my-terminal-file-manager-almost-killed-my-testing-career.md
   git mv article-v1-chaos-to-order.md → 01-from-chaos-to-component-order.md
   git mv article-v2-tsranger-journey.md → 02-from-quick-win-to-test-hell-to-ucp.md
   git mv article-v3-consciousness-journey.md → 03-the-code-that-taught-me-to-think.md
   ```

3. **Moved PDCAs to Previous Session**
   - Created subdirectory `sprint-12-work/` in previous session
   - Moved all PDCAs preserving original structure
   - Maintained traceability

4. **Consolidated Planning**
   - Merged article series strategy into main planning
   - Removed redundant planning files
   - Updated with current status and locations

5. **Created Cleanup Agent Task**
   - Task 12.2 for future automation
   - CI/CD integration planned

## ✅ Check

### Validation
- ✅ All articles in proper location
- ✅ PDCAs in journal session structure

- ✅ References will be updated

### User Quote
> "focus is highest prio. cleanup has to always happen at eod. maybe cicd could start a cleanup agent regularly…"

## 🔄 Act

### Improvements
1. **Immediate**: Complete reference updates
2. **Future**: Implement automated cleanup agent (Task 12.2)
3. **Learning**: Structure drift is natural during focus work
4. **Process**: EOD cleanup sessions protect both focus and structure

### Next Steps
1. Commit and push cleanup changes
2. Update remaining references
3. Return to article writing focus
4. Implement cleanup automation in future sprint
