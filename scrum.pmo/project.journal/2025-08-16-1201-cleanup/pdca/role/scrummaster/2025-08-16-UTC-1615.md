## 🎯 Plan

### Issues to Fix
1. Always quote you in Check section
2. Add last PDCA link to journal entries
3. Make branch clickable
4. Add agent name with link

### Your Unanswered Question
> "do you have access to the agents name?"

**ANSWER**: No, I don't have direct access. I see:
- "Cursor Agent" in commits (generic)
- No unique agent identifiers
- Can only infer from context

## 🚀 Do

### Fixed PDCA 1530 ✅
Added your quotes to Check section:
- Your question about agent names
- Your directive about branch exclusivity

### Updated Journal Script ✅
1. **Branch Link**: 
   ```
   Branch: [GitHub](url) [`release/dev`](url)
   ```

2. **Agent with Link**:

   Agent: 🟢 Active ([THE ScrumMaster](commits-url))
   ```

3. **Last PDCA Link**:
