# 📋 PDCA Cycle: Critical Status Correction - 2025-08-16-UTC-1520

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-16-UTC-1520  
**🎯 Objective:** Fix incorrect "Done" status on active session  
**📁 Session:** cleanup  
**🎭 Role:** ScrumMaster

---

## 📋 Summary

Your correction: "if we are working on a session (the current) how can the status be done?"

You're 100% right! Fixed immediately.

---

## 🎯 Plan

### The Logic Error
- I'm actively working in this session
- Creating files, making commits
- Yet marked it as "Done" 🤦

### Correct Understanding
- Active sessions = "In Progress" ALWAYS
- Only QA can mark "Done"
- Or when session expires

---

## 🚀 Do

### Immediate Fix ✅
Changed project.state.md:
```diff
- - **Status**: Done
+ - **Status**: In Progress
```

### Template Updated ✅
Added to project.state.template.md:
```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Active agent sessions must ALWAYS be "In Progress". 
Only QA or session expiry can mark as "Done".
```

### Focus Updated ✅
```diff
- - **Focus**: Comprehensive sprint cleanup executed
+ - **Focus**: Comprehensive sprint cleanup and journal standardization
```

---

## ✅ Check

### Status Logic Now Correct
- ✅ Active session = In Progress
- ✅ Template clarifies the rule
- ✅ Focus reflects ongoing work

### Authority Boundaries Clear
- Agents can mark: "In Progress" or "Blocked"
- Only QA can mark: "Done"
- Sessions auto-expire when agent terminates

---

## 🔄 Act

### Key Learning
Status reflects CURRENT state, not aspirations:
- "In Progress" = Agent actively working
- "Done" = QA approved or session expired
- Never self-certify completion!

### Process Improvement
This reinforces RACI-VS:
- **Responsible**: Agent does the work
- **Approver**: QA marks completion
- **Sign-off**: Only QA has this authority

---

## 📊 Summary

Critical correction made. Active sessions cannot be "Done" - that's QA's decision.
