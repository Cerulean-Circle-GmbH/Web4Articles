# 📋 PDCA Cycle: Agent Awareness in Journal - 2025-08-16-UTC-1510

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-16-UTC-1510  
**🎯 Objective:** Add branch and agent status to journal overview  
**📁 Session:** cleanup  
**🎭 Role:** ScrumMaster

---

## 📋 Summary

Your insight: "the current session is YOUR BRANCH and where YOU add files"

Added branch info and agent status to show WHO is working WHERE.

---

## 🎯 Plan

### Requirements
1. Show branch for each session
2. Show if a background agent is active
3. Mark expired sessions
4. Make it clear which is MY workspace

---

## 🚀 Do

### Script Enhanced ✅
Added to journal overview:
- **Branch**: Extracted from project.state.md
- **Agent**: Shows status
  - 🟢 Active (Background Agent)
  - ⚫ Expired

### Key Insight
As a background agent, this cleanup session is MY active workspace where I:
- Create files
- Make commits
- Push to MY branch (release/dev)

Other agents may have different branches/sessions.

### Format Now Shows
```
- **Role**: ScrumMaster
- **Status**: Done
- **Branch**: release/dev
- **Agent**: 🟢 Active (Background Agent)
```

---

## ✅ Check

### What Works
- ✅ Branch extraction working
- ✅ Agent status shows for all sessions
- ✅ Clear which sessions are expired

### Issue Found
- Active session detection broken (shows overview.md as latest)
- Should show THIS session (2025-08-16-1201-cleanup) as Active

---

## 🔄 Act

### Understanding Clarified
Each session represents:
1. A specific agent's workspace
2. Working on a specific branch
3. With specific permissions/lifetime
4. Creating real commits/files

### Future Enhancement
- Show agent type (Background/Interactive)
- Show session expiry time
- Show commits made in session

---

## 📊 Summary

Journal now shows agent presence and branch context. Makes clear which sessions are active workspaces vs historical records.
