> "ok. what you plan. what do you do next"
> "yes"

- Create bridge to Article 3

---

## 🚀 Do

### 1. Created Article 2 ✅

**File**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/articles/medium.com/sprint-13-series/02-the-one-folder-that-changed-everything.md) [./articles/medium.com/sprint-13-series/02-the-one-folder-that-changed-everything.md](file:///workspace/articles/medium.com/sprint-13-series/02-the-one-folder-that-changed-everything.md)

**Narrative Flow**:
1. Success trap - TEST_MODE worked, features exploded
2. Breaking point - embarrassing moment with new developer
3. Accidental discovery - desperation organization
4. Surprise benefits - structure as documentation
5. Call to action - reader's own experiment

### 2. Created Sprint 13 Task ✅

**File**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-13/task-13.1-write-one-folder-article.md) [./scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-13/task-13.1-write-one-folder-article.md](file:///workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-13/task-13.1-write-one-folder-article.md)

Documented article requirements and success metrics.

### 3. Key Article Features ✅

**Relatable Pain Points**:
- "47 more files" in flat structure
- Can't find FileManager vs FileHandler vs FileController
- "This wasn't a codebase. It was a yard sale."

**Natural Discovery**:
- No methodology mentioned
- "Just pure desperation organization"
- Accident that revealed deeper patterns

**Practical Examples**:
```bash
mkdir components/TSRanger
mv TSRanger* components/TSRanger/
```

**Hook for Article 3**:
"And that's when my QA partner said something that changed how I think about code forever..."

## ✅ Check

### Requirements Met
> "No RACI-VS, PDCA, or Web4x terminology"

✅ None of these terms appear in the article

> "Build from Article 1's test solution"

✅ Opens with "Remember that terminal file manager from my last article?"

> "Natural discovery of component organization"

✅ Presented as accidental desperation move, not planned architecture

### Quality Markers
- Conversational tone maintained
- Technical accuracy without jargon
- Clear before/after examples
- Actionable steps for readers

---

## 🔄 Act

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Review article for typos and flow
2. Add actual link to Article 1
3. Consider creating visual diagram of folder structure
4. Push changes (maintaining discipline)

### Article Series Progress
- ✅ Article 1: Test solution (complete)
- ✅ Article 2: Component discovery (draft complete)
- 📝 Article 3: QA collaboration (next)
- 📋 Article 4: Architecture patterns (planned)
- 📋 Article 5: Consciousness concepts (planned)

### Success Indicators
- Natural flow from problem to solution
- No premature concept reveals
- Strong hook for next article
- Practical value delivered
