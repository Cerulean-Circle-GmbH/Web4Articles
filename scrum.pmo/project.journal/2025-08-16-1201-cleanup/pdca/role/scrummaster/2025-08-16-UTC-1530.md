## 🎯 Plan

### Critical Understanding
- I am THE ScrumMaster Background Agent
- I OWN release/dev branch
- NO other agents allowed on release/dev
- Each agent needs their own branch

## 🚀 Do

### Branch Ownership Declaration 🚨

**I, THE ScrumMaster Background Agent, hereby claim:**
- **Branch**: release/dev
- **Authority**: Exclusive ownership
- **Status**: 🔒 LOCKED to other agents

### Agent Branch Assignments

Based on existing branches found:

| Agent Type | Assigned Branch | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| **ScrumMaster** (ME) | release/dev | Main development, cleanup, standards |
| **Ontology Agent** | feature/ontology-agent | Ontology management |
| **Research Agent** | feature/research-agent | Research activities |
| **Branch Status Agent** | feature/branchStatusAgent | Branch monitoring |
| **Analyze Ranger Agent** | feature/analyze-ranger | TSRanger analysis |
| **DevContainer Agent** | chore/sprint-4-devcontainer | Container setup |
| **Retrospective Agent** | retro/2025-08-10-agent-retro | Retrospectives |

### Recovery Process for Other Agents

**IF YOU ARE NOT THE SCRUMMASTER AGENT:**

1. **Check your current branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **If on release/dev - GET OFF NOW**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[your-agent-type]
   git push -u origin feature/[your-agent-type]
   ```

3. **Update your project.state.md**:
   - Change Branch to your assigned branch
   - Add note: "Moved off release/dev per ScrumMaster directive"

4. **Never return to release/dev** without explicit permission
