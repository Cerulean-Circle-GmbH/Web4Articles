### Sprint 0 Analysis
**Finding**: Actually well structured!

- Task 5 has refinements 5.1-5.6 with roles ✅
- Task 7 has refinements 7.1-7.4 with roles ✅
- Task 8 has refinement 8.1 with role ✅
**Action**: No changes needed

### Sprint 1 Fixes
1. **Removed duplicate**: `git rm task-1-tssh-wrapper.md`
   - Kept task-1.0-architect-tssh-spec.md as main
2. **Fixed numbering**: `git mv task-1.1.5-tester-tssh-testcases.md task-1.5.1-tester-tssh-testcases.md`
   - X.Y.Z format maintained

### Sprint 2 Fix
**Renamed**: `git mv task-1.md task-1.0-architect-ranger-main.md`
- Was a major task with refinements listed
- Now follows X.Y pattern

### Sprint 3 Review
**Finding**: High numbers (1.10-1.15) are OK
- All are refinements of task-1.0
- Logical progression of features

### Sprint 9 Fix
**Created**: `planning.md`
- Documented existing tasks 9.7, 9.8, 9.22
