- Local processes tracking
- Branch ownership rules enforcement
- Activity metrics and statistics
- Alerts & violations monitoring

### 2. Created Automated Detection Script âœ…

**Script**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/release/dev/scripts/detect-active-agents.sh) [./scripts/detect-active-agents.sh](file:///workspace/scripts/detect-active-agents.sh)

Capabilities:
- Analyzes git branches for recent activity
- Determines agent status (Active/Semi-active/Dormant)
- Finds latest sessions for each agent
- Checks system processes
- Detects branch violations
- Generates comprehensive report

### 3. Updated Journal Overview âœ…

**Script Updated**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/release/dev/scripts/update-journal-overview.sh) [./scripts/update-journal-overview.sh](file:///workspace/scripts/update-journal-overview.sh)

âœ… Active agents section now appears automatically in every journal overview update

> "link to each project status"

âœ… Each agent entry includes:
- Session links (GitHub + local)
- Branch links
- Last PDCA links (where applicable)

### Detection Results

- **Dormant**: 3 (QA, Article, Developer)

---

## ðŸ”„ Act

### Next Steps
1. **Schedule Regular Updates**: Consider cron job for `detect-active-agents.sh`
2. **Branch Protection**: Implement automated branch protection based on ownership
3. **Agent Notifications**: Alert agents when they become dormant
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Consider web dashboard for real-time status

### Usage Instructions
```bash
# Update agent status
./scripts/detect-active-agents.sh

# Update journal overview (includes agents)
./scripts/update-journal-overview.sh

# View current status
cat /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/active-agents.md
```

### Integration Complete âœ…
The active agents tracking is now a core part of the project journal system!
