# 📋 PDCA Cycle: Agent Context Isolation - 2025-08-16-UTC-1555

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-16-UTC-1555  
**🎯 Objective:** Create agent-specific journal overviews  
**📁 Session:** cleanup  
**🎭 Role:** ScrumMaster

---

## 📋 Summary

Your directive: "update the project journal overview so each agent has its own and is own its current context"

Created agent isolation system!

---

## 🎯 Plan

### Requirements
1. Each agent gets their own journal overview
2. Shows only their sessions/context
3. Prevents cross-contamination
4. Enforces branch boundaries

---

## 🚀 Do

### Created Agent-Specific Overview Script ✅
`/workspace/scripts/generate-agent-journal-overview.sh`

**Features**:
- Detects current branch
- Identifies agent based on branch
- Generates personalized overview
- Shows ONLY sessions for that agent/branch
- Creates: `project.journal.overview.[branch-name].md`

### Agent Mappings Established
```bash
release/dev → THE ScrumMaster
feature/recovery-agent → Recovery Agent
feature/ontology-agent → Ontology Agent
feature/research-agent → Research Agent
feature/branchStatusAgent → Branch Status Agent
feature/qa-validation → QA Agent
```

### My Overview Generated ✅
- File: `project.journal.overview.release-dev.md`
- Found: 15 sessions for THE ScrumMaster
- Shows: Only MY work on MY branch

---

## ✅ Check

### Isolation Benefits
- ✅ Each agent sees only their context
- ✅ No confusion about which sessions to work in
- ✅ Branch boundaries enforced visually
- ✅ Clear ownership established

### Recovery Agent Impact
When Recovery Agent runs the script on `feature/recovery-agent`:
- Will see ONLY their sessions
- Cannot see my cleanup session
- Must create their own sessions
- Stays in their lane!

---

## 🔄 Act

### Message to Recovery Agent
```
TO: Recovery Agent

Per ScrumMaster directive:
1. git checkout -b feature/recovery-agent
2. ./scripts/generate-agent-journal-overview.sh
3. Work ONLY in sessions shown in YOUR overview
4. Create new sessions on YOUR branch

Your overview: project.journal.overview.feature-recovery-agent.md
```

### Future Enhancement
- Auto-generate on branch switch
- Add to recovery process
- Integrate with CI/CD

---

## 📊 Summary

Agent context isolation implemented. Each agent now has their own journal overview showing only their work.
