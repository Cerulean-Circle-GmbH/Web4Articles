## Project Status
- **Session Type**: Cleanup (EOD Structure Fix)
- **Role**: ScrumMaster (cleanup focus)
- **Branch**: release/dev
- **Focus**: Sprint 12 structural cleanup per project standards

## Current Objectives
1. **Move Articles**: From sprint-12 to `/workspace/articles/medium.com/`
2. **Move PDCAs**: From sprint-12 to proper journal session (preserving timestamps)
3. **Clean Sprint Folder**: Only planning.md, requirements.md, tasks/
4. **Update References**: Fix all broken links
5. **Document Process**: For future automated cleanup

## Session Context
Following user wisdom:
> "focus is highest prio. cleanup has to always happen at eod"

This cleanup session addresses structural drift in Sprint 12 where:
- PDCAs were created directly in sprint folder
- Articles were stored in sprint folder
- Multiple planning files existed

## Key Decisions
1. **New Session**: Created dedicated cleanup session (this one)
2. **Preserve Timestamps**: Keep original PDCA timestamps
3. **Future Automation**: Task 12.2 plans CI/CD cleanup agent

## Cleanup Plan
1. Create proper directory structure
2. Use `git mv` to preserve history
3. Update all internal references
4. Consolidate planning documents
5. Create requirements.md from PDCAs

## Next Steps
After cleanup:
- Return to article writing focus
- Implement automated cleanup agent
- Continue Sprint 12 execution
