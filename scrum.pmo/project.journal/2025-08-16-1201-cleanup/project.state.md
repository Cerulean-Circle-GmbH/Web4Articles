- [📁 **This Session**](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/tree/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1201-cleanup)

## Project Status

- **Session Type**: Cleanup (EOD Structure Fix)
- **Role**: ScrumMaster (THE ScrumMaster Background Agent)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Branch**: release/dev (🔒 EXCLUSIVE OWNERSHIP)
- **Agent**: THE ScrumMaster - Master of release/dev
- **Focus**: Comprehensive cleanup, standardization, and branch governance

## Current Objectives
- [x] **Move Articles**: From sprint-12 to `/workspace/articles/medium.com/`
- [x] **Move PDCAs**: From sprint-12 to proper journal session (preserving timestamps)
- [x] **Clean Sprint Folder**: Only planning.md, requirements.md, tasks/
- [x] **Update References**: Fix all broken links
- [x] **Document Process**: For future automated cleanup

## Additional Tasks Completed
- [x] **Comprehensive Sprint Cleanup**: Fixed structures in Sprints 0-3, 5-8, 10, 17
- [x] **Created Validation Script**: `validate-sprint-structure.sh` for compliance checking
- [x] **Standardized Journal Overview**: Fixed role/status extraction, added branch awareness
- [x] **Implemented Agent Tracking**: Created session-based agent snapshots
- [x] **Fixed GitHub URLs**: Updated all links to correct repository
- [x] **Established Branch Ownership**: One Agent = One Branch policy enforced

## Recurring Issues (Self-Inflicted)
- [ ] **Remember to Push**: Failed multiple times to push after commit
- [ ] **Use Dual Links**: Repeatedly forgot despite 10+ reminders
- [ ] **Quote in PDCAs**: Inconsistent quoting in Check sections
- [ ] **Stop Celebrating Basics**: No more "discovering" things already taught

## Session Context
Following user wisdom:
> "focus is highest prio. cleanup has to always happen at eod"

This cleanup session addresses structural drift in Sprint 12 where:
- PDCAs were created directly in sprint folder
- Articles were stored in sprint folder
- Multiple planning files existed

## Key Decisions
1. **New Session**: Created dedicated cleanup session (this one)
2. **Preserve Timestamps**: Keep original PDCA timestamps
3. **Future Automation**: Task 12.2 plans CI/CD cleanup agent

## Cleanup Plan
1. Create proper directory structure
2. Use `git mv` to preserve history
3. Update all internal references
4. Consolidate planning documents
5. Create requirements.md from PDCAs

## Next Steps
After cleanup:
- Return to article writing focus
- Implement automated cleanup agent
- Continue Sprint 12 execution
- Master basic discipline (push, links, quotes)

## Session Summary
Started: 2025-08-16-1201 UTC  
PDCAs Created: 28  
Major Accomplishments: Comprehensive sprint cleanup, agent tracking system  
Major Failures: Repeatedly forgetting basic instructions (push, dual links, quotes)
