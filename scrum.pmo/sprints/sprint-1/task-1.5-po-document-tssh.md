# Task 1.4: PO - Document tssh approach

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Goal
Document the `tssh` CLI tool and its architecture, usage, and completion logic for developers and testers, with emphasis on:
- Interactive, context-aware UX (fuzzy search, inline/tab completion, navigation)
- Real-time TypeScript class/method/parameter discovery (project and node_modules)
- Ability to call any class method with arguments, with suggestions and validation
- Strict ESM, OOP, and extensibility (plugins, context help, UI enhancements)
- Robust CLI integration, Bash completion, and OOSH/tssh integration

## Documentation Tasks
- Describe the shell script wrapper, backend, and completion logic.
- Document how to install and use `tssh` and its completion.
- Document the architecture and design decisions, including:
    - Interactive, context-aware UX (fuzzy search, inline/tab completion, navigation)
    - Real-time TypeScript class/method/parameter discovery (project and node_modules)
    - Ability to call any class method with arguments, with suggestions and validation
    - Strict ESM, OOP, and extensibility (plugins, context help, UI enhancements)
    - Robust CLI integration, Bash completion, and OOSH/tssh integration
- Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation covers the shell script, backend, and completion logic.
- Usage and installation instructions are clear.
- Architecture and design decisions are documented, including advanced UX, discovery, extensibility, and OOSH/tssh integration.
