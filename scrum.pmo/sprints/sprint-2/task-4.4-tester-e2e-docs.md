  - [task:uuid:3c9a7b42-8f1e-4f23-ae6d-9c5e0b7a12d3](./task-4.md)

## Goal
Add scripted test(s) to assert that selecting items populates the `Docs` column and that layout remains intact.

## Strategy
- Use existing test harness (scripted key sequences) to reach specific items and snapshot the docs region.
- Assert presence of known doc strings from test classes or fixtures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Scripted tests pass and are non-flaky.

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] QA review pending.
