# Task 7.1: Developer — FilterStateEngine Implementation
[subtask:uuid:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef]

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-7.1-developer-filter-state-engine.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Implement FilterStateEngine with immutable operations to prevent filter state corruption. Create centralized filter management that ensures atomic updates and prevents the [t][backspace][g] → "tg" bug.

## Context
The current filter implementation has scattered logic across multiple classes allowing state corruption. Need centralized FilterStateEngine with immutable operations that prevent state corruption through atomic updates.

**From Architect Analysis:** Filter state corruption occurs due to multiple disconnected filter update paths. Solution requires immutable operations with atomic state transitions.

## Intention
Create FilterStateEngine class that:
- Prevents filter state corruption through immutable operations
- Provides atomic filter updates with rollback capability
- Centralizes all filter logic in single responsible class
- Eliminates scattered filter update paths

## Steps
1. **Design FilterStateEngine interface** with immutable operations
2. **Implement atomic filter operations**: addCharacter, removeCharacter, clearFilter
3. **Add state validation** to prevent invalid state transitions
4. **Create FilterResult** wrapper for operation results
5. **Implement rollback capability** for error recovery
6. **Add comprehensive logging** for filter state changes

## Requirements
- **Immutable Operations:** All filter operations must be immutable and atomic
- **State Validation:** Prevent invalid filter state transitions
- **Centralized Logic:** Single source of truth for filter management
- **Rollback Capability:** Ability to revert filter operations
- **Performance:** No degradation in filter operation speed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** FilterStateEngine class implemented with immutable operations
- [ ] **AC2:** addCharacter() method prevents state corruption
- [ ] **AC3:** removeCharacter() method handles backspace safely
- [ ] **AC4:** clearFilter() method resets state properly
- [ ] **AC5:** State validation prevents invalid transitions
- [ ] **AC6:** FilterResult wrapper provides operation feedback
- [ ] **AC7:** Rollback capability enables error recovery
- [ ] **AC8:** Comprehensive unit tests for all operations

## Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
class FilterStateEngine {
  private readonly state: FilterState;
  
  // Atomic operation prevents [t][backspace][g] → "tg" corruption
  addCharacter(char: string): FilterResult {
    const newState = {
      ...this.state,
      filter: this.state.filter + char,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    return new FilterResult(newState, this.getFilteredItems(newState.filter));
  }
  
  // Immutable operation for safe backspace
  removeCharacter(): FilterResult {
    const newFilter = this.state.filter.slice(0, -1);
    const newState = {
      ...this.state,
      filter: newFilter,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    return new FilterResult(newState, this.getFilteredItems(newFilter));
  }
}
```
