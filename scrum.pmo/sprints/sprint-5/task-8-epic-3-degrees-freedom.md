# Task 8: Epic — 3 Degrees of Freedom Architecture Implementation
[task:uuid:d5e6f7g8-h9i0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-8.1-architect-column-navigator.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

- In `requiremnents.md`, append the same UUID and a link back to this task (`([task-8](./task-8-epic-3-degrees-freedom.md))`).
- For each subtask, add `[subtask:uuid:<uuidv4>]`.

## Task Description
**FUTURE EPIC (Sprint 6-7):** Implement the revolutionary 3 Degrees of Freedom architecture with clean separation of COLUMNS (navigation) + PROMPT (display) + FILTER (search) concerns for long-term maintainability and bug prevention.

## Context
TRON taught the revolutionary 3 Degrees of Freedom framework: "tsranger has 3 degrees of freedom. like in cluedo board game." The Architect analysis produced comprehensive PUML diagrams and architectural design for this transformative approach.

**Epic Story:**
> As a TSRanger development team, we want to implement the revolutionary 3 Degrees of Freedom architecture (COLUMNS + PROMPT + FILTER) so that we have clean separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and a framework that prevents entire classes of bugs.

## Intention
Implement comprehensive architecture that:
- Separates COLUMNS (navigation) + PROMPT (display) + FILTER (search) concerns
- Provides clean interfaces for each degree of freedom
- Prevents entire classes of bugs through design
- Enables long-term maintainability and enhancement

## Steps
1. **ColumnNavigator Interface Design** (Task 8.1): Encapsulated column behavior with consistent interfaces
2. **TSRangerOrchestrator Implementation** (Task 8.2): Coordination layer for all 3 degrees
3. **Complete Architecture Migration** (Task 8.3): Full migration from current to 3 Degrees architecture

## Requirements
- Include `[requirement:uuid:d5e6f7g8-h9i0-1234-5678-9abcdef01234]` backlink to `requiremnents.md`.
- Ensure bidirectional links: task → requirements and requirements → task.
- **Clean Separation:** COLUMNS + PROMPT + FILTER completely separated
- **Interface Design:** Consistent interfaces for each degree of freedom
- **Bug Prevention:** Architecture prevents state corruption and logic mixing
- **Maintainability:** Clean, extensible design for future enhancements
- **Performance:** No degradation compared to current implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Epic AC1:** Complete architecture migration from current to 3 Degrees of Freedom design
- [ ] **Epic AC2:** All PUML diagrams implemented in actual code structure
- [ ] **Epic AC3:** Performance maintains or improves compared to current implementation
- [ ] **Epic AC4:** All existing functionality preserved during migration
- [ ] **Epic AC5:** Clean separation of COLUMNS + PROMPT + FILTER concerns
- [ ] **Epic AC6:** Consistent interfaces for each degree of freedom
- [ ] **Epic AC7:** Bug prevention through architectural design
- [ ] **Epic AC8:** Long-term maintainability and extensibility achieved

## Epic Sub-Tasks
1. **Task 8.1 — Architect: ColumnNavigator Interface Design** (8 hours)
   - Design consistent interfaces for all column types
   - Define navigation contracts and behaviors
   - Create column encapsulation specifications

2. **Task 8.2 — Developer: TSRangerOrchestrator Implementation** (8 hours)  
   - Implement coordination layer for 3 degrees
   - Create state management and integration logic
   - Ensure proper degree coordination

3. **Task 8.3 — Developer: Complete Architecture Migration** (16-24 hours)
   - Migrate all existing code to 3 Degrees architecture
   - Ensure backward compatibility and functionality preservation
   - Complete integration testing and validation
