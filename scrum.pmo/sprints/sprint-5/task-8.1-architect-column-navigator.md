# Task 8.1: Architect â€” ColumnNavigator Interface Design
[subtask:uuid:i9j0k1l2-m3n4-5678-9012-345678ijklmn]

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-8.1-architect-column-navigator.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned

## Task Description
Design ColumnNavigator interface with consistent contracts for all column types (Classes, Methods, Parameters, Docs) as part of the 3 Degrees of Freedom architecture.

## Context
Part of the revolutionary 3 Degrees of Freedom architecture where COLUMNS represent the "WHO/WHERE" degree. Need consistent interfaces for encapsulated column behavior.

## Intention
Design interface that provides:
- Consistent navigation contracts across all columns
- Encapsulated column behavior with clear responsibilities
- Clean separation from PROMPT and FILTER concerns
- Extensible design for future column types

## Steps
1. **Define ColumnNavigator interface** with core navigation methods
2. **Design column-specific implementations** (Classes, Methods, Parameters, Docs)
3. **Create navigation result structures** for consistent data flow
4. **Define column state management** interfaces
5. **Document interface contracts** and usage patterns

## Requirements
- **Consistent Interface:** All columns implement same navigation contract
- **Encapsulation:** Column behavior properly encapsulated
- **Separation:** Clean separation from prompt and filter logic
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new column types
- **Performance:** Efficient navigation operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** ColumnNavigator interface defined with core navigation methods
- [ ] **AC2:** Column-specific implementations designed (Classes, Methods, Parameters, Docs)
- [ ] **AC3:** Navigation result structures provide consistent data flow
- [ ] **AC4:** Column state management interfaces defined
- [ ] **AC5:** Interface contracts documented with usage patterns
- [ ] **AC6:** Design supports extensibility for future columns
- [ ] **AC7:** Performance considerations addressed in design
- [ ] **AC8:** Integration with TSRangerOrchestrator specified
