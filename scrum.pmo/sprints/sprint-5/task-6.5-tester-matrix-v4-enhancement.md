# Task 6.5: Tester â€” Matrix v4 Gap Analysis and Test Enhancement
[subtask:uuid:f6g7h8i9-j0k1-2345-6789-012345fghijk]

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-6.5-tester-matrix-v4-enhancement.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Task Description
Analyze Matrix v4 gaps identified through TRON QA testing and enhance test coverage for newly discovered edge cases. Update Matrix v4 with comprehensive test scenarios that prevent regressions.

## Context
TRON QA testing revealed gaps in Matrix v4 coverage, particularly for multi-step filter operations and state management scenarios. Need to enhance Matrix v4 with discovered edge cases.

**From Tester Analysis:**
> "Matrix v4 covers basic scenarios but misses edge cases. Filter corruption and state management not addressed."

## Intention
Enhance Matrix v4 with:
- All TRON QA discoveries documented as test scenarios
- Multi-step filter operation test coverage
- Navigation stress testing for long chains
- State recovery and graceful degradation testing

## Steps
1. **Analyze Matrix v4 gaps** against TRON QA findings
2. **Add multi-step filter operation scenarios**
3. **Include navigation stress testing**
4. **Add state corruption recovery scenarios**
5. **Document edge cases** for comprehensive coverage
6. **Update Matrix v4** with enhanced test scenarios

## Requirements
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All TRON QA findings have corresponding test scenarios
- **Edge Case Focus:** Multi-step operations and complex sequences
- **Regression Prevention:** Test scenarios prevent future regressions
- **Documentation:** Clear test scenarios for maintenance
- **Matrix Integration:** Updates integrate cleanly with existing Matrix v4

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** All TRON QA findings documented as test scenarios in Matrix v4
- [ ] **AC2:** Multi-step filter operation test scenarios added
- [ ] **AC3:** Navigation stress testing for long chains included
- [ ] **AC4:** State corruption recovery scenarios documented
- [ ] **AC5:** Edge case test scenarios prevent regression
- [ ] **AC6:** Matrix v4 updated with enhanced scenarios
- [ ] **AC7:** Test documentation clear for future maintenance
- [ ] **AC8:** All new scenarios validate against current TSRanger implementation

## Matrix v4 Enhancement Areas
**Missing Scenarios Identified:**
1. **Multi-Step Filter Operations:**
   - [type][backspace][type] sequences
   - Complex filter state management
   - Filter operation chains

2. **Navigation Stress Testing:**
   - Long navigation chains validation
   - Navigation bounds testing
   - Multi-column navigation sequences

3. **State Recovery Scenarios:**
   - Corrupted state recovery testing
   - Application restart scenarios
   - Graceful degradation validation

4. **DRY/OOP Behavioral Equivalence:**
   - Paired operation equivalence testing
   - Shared method validation
   - Behavioral consistency verification
