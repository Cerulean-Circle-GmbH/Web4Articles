# Task 8.3: Developer â€” Complete Architecture Migration
[subtask:uuid:k1l2m3n4-o5p6-7890-1234-567890klmnop]

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-8.3-developer-architecture-migration.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Complete migration of TSRanger from current architecture to 3 Degrees of Freedom architecture, ensuring all functionality is preserved and performance is maintained or improved.

## Context
Final phase of 3 Degrees of Freedom implementation. Migrate all existing TSRanger code to use ColumnNavigator, PromptStateManager, FilterStateEngine, and TSRangerOrchestrator.

## Intention
Complete migration that:
- Preserves all existing functionality
- Improves maintainability through clean separation
- Maintains or improves performance
- Enables future architectural enhancements

## Steps
1. **Migrate existing code** to 3 Degrees architecture
2. **Ensure backward compatibility** with existing functionality
3. **Validate performance** meets or exceeds current implementation
4. **Complete integration testing** across all components
5. **Update documentation** to reflect new architecture
6. **Provide migration validation** and sign-off

## Requirements
- **Functionality Preservation:** All existing features work unchanged
- **Performance:** No degradation from current implementation
- **Clean Migration:** No legacy code or architectural debt
- **Integration:** All components work together seamlessly
- **Documentation:** Architecture properly documented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** All existing TSRanger functionality preserved unchanged
- [ ] **AC2:** Performance meets or exceeds current implementation
- [ ] **AC3:** Clean migration with no legacy architectural debt
- [ ] **AC4:** All components integrate seamlessly
- [ ] **AC5:** Comprehensive testing validates complete system
- [ ] **AC6:** Documentation updated to reflect 3 Degrees architecture
- [ ] **AC7:** Migration validation and sign-off completed
- [ ] **AC8:** Future extensibility enabled through clean architecture

## QA Audit & User Feedback
