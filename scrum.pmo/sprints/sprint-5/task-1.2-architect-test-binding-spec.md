# Task 1.2 â€” Architect: Test-Binding Spec to Reuse Existing Tests

## Status
- Planned

## Traceability
- Up: [requirement:uuid:718293a4-b5c6-4f3b-4c5d-6e7f8091a2b3], [requirement:uuid:93a4b5c6-d7e8-4f5d-6e7f-8091a2b3c4d5]

## Description
Define how the current tests under `test/tsranger.*.test.ts` invoke v2 without changing test files, including the non-interactive mode contract and environment variables.

## Binding Requirements
- `src/sh/tsranger test "<keys>"` must execute v2 when an environment switch is set (e.g., `TSRANGER_V2=1`) while preserving the same CLI syntax used by tests.
- `TSRANGER_TEST_MODE=1`, `TSRANGER_TEST_INPUT`, and `TS_RANGER_TEST_FINAL_ONLY=1` are honored identically.
- Terminal width/height are controllable for tests; IO abstraction provides fixed dimensions and frame capture.
- ANSI usage: tests expect colors in prompt/footer but assertions read textual layout; ensure deterministic output.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A clear routing proposal that requires only setting an environment variable in CI/local to run v2 against existing tests.
- A mapping table of each test file to the v2 components they validate (see Task 3.1).
