# Task 5.5: PO - Planning & Acceptance

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [x] In Progress
  - [x] refinement
  - [ ] implementing
  - [ ] testing
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
The Product Owner (PO) defines requirements and acceptance criteria for subproject setup, reviews subtasks, and ensures all roles are covered. The PO accepts or rejects completed work based on the acceptance criteria.

## Context
- This subtask is derived from Task 5 and focuses on planning, requirements, and acceptance.

## Intention
- Ensure all requirements and acceptance criteria are clear, complete, and reviewed for all roles.

## Steps
- Enforce MAIN/SUBTASK scheme in planning: MAIN tasks are `task-N`, role-specific SUBTASKS are `task-N.M` (M starts at 1). Only MAIN tasks may be in refinement.
- Ensure all tasks and files follow the PO templates (status, QA audit, subtasks) and begin with a first-line backlink to planning.
- Assign UUID v4 to each requirement; add `[requirement:uuid:<uuidv4>]` in the MAIN task and append the same UUID with a task link in `requiremnents.md`.
- Maintain bidirectional traceability when tasks are renamed or regrouped; update links atomically in tasks and `requiremnents.md`.
- Validate artifacts and diagrams are embedded (e.g., PlantUML → SVG) and rendering commands are documented for the Architect.
- Verify environment prerequisites (Docker/devcontainer, Node engines, PlantUML/Graphviz, gh) are captured and linked to DevOps tasks.
- Normalize planning labels to match filenames; avoid duplicate subtask listings outside MAIN task blocks.
- Run a merge-health test pass (`npm test`) and record outcomes in `recovery.md`.

## Requirements
- Requirements must exist in `sprint-0/requiremnents.md` with UUIDs and short problem→fix notes.
- Each MAIN task references its originating requirement via a UUID backlink; `requiremnents.md` links to the MAIN task.
- Planning reflects consistent numbering and no duplicate entries.
- Tasks embed artifacts (e.g., SVGs) where applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `sprint-0/requiremnents.md` contains all QA-derived requirements with UUIDs and examples.
- `planning.md` shows MAIN tasks with nested SUBTASKS; numbering matches filenames and headers; no redundant lists.
- All tasks start with a backlink and conform to the PO template sections (Status, QA Audit, Subtasks).
- Bidirectional requirement↔task links are present and correct after any rename/regroup.
- Architect diagrams render without errors; SVGs embedded where relevant.
- Environment verification steps are present and actionable (or delegated to devcontainer sprint).

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] QA review pending.
- [ ] Feedback to be collected after acceptance review.

## Subtasks
- None (atomic subtask for this sprint).
