# Sprint 0 Planning

## Sprint Goal
The goal for Sprint 0 is to establish the foundational project structure, documentation, and onboarding workflow. This includes setting up the SCRUM management directories, adding the project wiki as a submodule, creating the ontology page, documenting role responsibilities, and providing a template for new subprojects. All tasks must follow the agreed template and naming conventions to ensure clarity, traceability, and rapid onboarding for all roles.
