# Sprint 0 Planning

## Sprint Goal
The goal for Sprint 0 is to establish the foundational project structure, documentation, and onboarding workflow. This includes setting up the SCRUM management directories, adding the project wiki as a submodule, creating the ontology page, documenting role responsibilities, and providing a template for new subprojects. All tasks must follow the agreed template and naming conventions to ensure clarity, traceability, and rapid onboarding for all roles.

**Process Update (2025-08-03):**
Sprint 0 tasks are now listed, priorities are set, and all links/numbering are correct. All tasks follow the new template format and are ready for execution. QA feedback and audit learnings will be captured in each task's QA section and in the sprint audit file.
