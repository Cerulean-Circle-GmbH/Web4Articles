## 📋 Recovery Process

### If You Are On The Wrong Branch:

1. **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**

2. **Check your current branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

3. **If on someone else's branch (especially release/dev)**:
   ```bash
   # Stash your changes
   git stash
   
   # Move to YOUR assigned branch
   git checkout -b [your-assigned-branch]
   
   # Push your branch
   git push -u origin [your-assigned-branch]
   
   # Apply your stashed changes
   git stash pop
   ```

4. **Update your session's project.state.md**:
   ```markdown
   - **Branch**: [your-assigned-branch]
   - **Note**: Moved off [wrong-branch] per Agent Branch Assignment policy
   ```

5. **Create a PDCA documenting the branch change**
