# Task 7.3: Developer - Tree Index Tests

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases
  - [ ] implementing tests
  - [ ] coverage verification
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
- Developer: Create comprehensive test suite for the tree index generator including unit tests, integration tests, and edge case coverage. Ensure tests follow project testing standards and achieve high coverage.

## Context
- Tests must cover all functionality from Task 7.2 implementation
- Follow existing test patterns using Vitest
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test cross-platform compatibility

## Intention
- Ensure tree index generator reliability
- Verify all configuration options work correctly
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Validate markdown output format

## Steps
- [ ] Create unit tests for core tree traversal
- [ ] Test filtering and exclusion rules
- [ ] Verify markdown formatting output
- [ ] Test configuration system
- [ ] Create integration tests with TSRanger
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify cross-platform behavior
- [ ] Test performance with large directories
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

## Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Tree traversal logic
   - Filtering mechanisms
   - Markdown formatting
   - Configuration parsing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - TSRanger command integration
   - File system operations
   - Full generation workflow

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty directories
   - Circular symlinks
   - Permission errors
   - Large directory trees
   - Special characters in names

## Requirements
- Use Vitest testing framework
- Follow existing test patterns
- Mock file system where appropriate
- Test both success and failure paths
- Include performance benchmarks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test categories implemented
- [ ] Minimum 80% code coverage achieved
- [ ] Tests pass on all supported platforms
- [ ] Edge cases properly handled
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] CI integration verified

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- All feedback and audit entries must be timestamped (UTC) and documented in this section.
