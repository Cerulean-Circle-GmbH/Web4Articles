# Task 5.1: Architect - PlantUML Specification

[subtask:uuid:22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222]

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases
  - [ ] implementing
  - [ ] testing
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
The Architect will design and maintain the PlantUML specification for the CLI OOP architecture, ensuring it reflects the current implementation and supports strict OOP and layered principles.

## Context
- This subtask is derived from Task 5 and focuses on architectural documentation and visualization.
- The PlantUML diagram must be kept in sync with code and process changes.

## Intention
- Ensure the architecture is explicit, traceable, and supports onboarding and process improvement.

## Steps
- Enforce PlantUML syntax and class-diagram conventions (no single-line bodies, proper realization arrows, return types as helper classes).
- Add `plantuml` rendering commands to the Architect process and ensure local rendering works (Graphviz/Java installed).
- Create or update the PlantUML diagram in `src/puml` and embed the generated SVG in relevant tasks.
- Document the rationale and design decisions in the diagram and architect process.md.

## Requirements
- PlantUML diagram must reflect the current CLI and subproject creation architecture and render without errors.
- SVGs must be generated and embedded in tasks.
- All architectural decisions must be documented.

## Acceptance Criteria
- PlantUML diagram is up-to-date and accurately reflects the codebase.
- All architectural decisions are documented.

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] QA review pending.
- [ ] Feedback to be collected after diagram and documentation review.

## Subtasks
- None (atomic subtask for this sprint).
