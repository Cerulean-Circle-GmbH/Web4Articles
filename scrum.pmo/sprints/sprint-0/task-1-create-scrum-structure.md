## Status

- [x] In Progress
  - [x] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases
  - [x] implementing
  - [ ] testing
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
- PO: Establish the `scrum.pmo` directory with subfolders for roles and sprints. Document naming conventions and folder structure in `process.md`.

## Context
- The role derives the steps and understanding from the PO's task description and documents any additional context or constraints.

## Intention
- The PO double-checks that the role has captured the correct intent from the task description and context.

## Steps
- [x] Create the `scrum.pmo` directory.
- [x] Add `roles` and `sprints` subfolders.
- [x] Document the structure and naming conventions in `process.md`.
- [ ] Add `[task:uuid]` and `[subtask:uuid]` policies to PO process; ensure all tasks carry UUID tags.
- [ ] Ensure first-line backlinks are present and unique in all sprint tasks.
- [ ] Add `project.journal/_template/project.state.md` and document the policy to create a dated journal entry after each recovery under `scrum.pmo/project.journal/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>/`.

## Requirements
- The directory structure must match the SCRUM conventions.
- `process.md` must clearly document the conventions.
- UUID, backlink, and MAIN/SUBTASK numbering policies must be captured.
- Journal template and recovery journaling policy must be present under `scrum.pmo/project.journal` and referenced in recovery docs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Directory structure exists as specified.
- `process.md` documents the conventions clearly.
- All Sprint 0 tasks comply with backlink and UUID policies.

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- All feedback and audit entries must be timestamped (UTC) and documented in this section.
