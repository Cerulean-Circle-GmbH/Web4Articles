# Task 7.1: Architect - Tree Index Specification

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [x] In Progress
  - [x] refinement
  - [x] specification design
  - [x] PUML diagrams
  - [x] review
- [x] QA Review
- [x] Done

## Task Description
- Architect: Design the specification for tree.index.md files including format, structure, generation rules, and integration patterns. Create PlantUML diagrams showing the tree index generation workflow and component architecture.

## Context
- Tree index files will provide automated documentation of directory structures
- Must integrate with existing TypeScript tooling architecture
- Should follow CMM Level 4 principles for automated documentation
- Needs to support both manual and automated generation

## Intention
- Define clear specification for tree.index.md format
- Establish generation rules and filtering criteria
- Design component architecture for the generator
- Create visual documentation of the process flow

## Steps
- [x] Define tree.index.md markdown format specification
- [x] Specify filtering rules (what to include/exclude)
- [x] Design TypeScript component architecture
- [x] Create PlantUML diagram for generation workflow
- [x] Define integration points with TSRanger/TSsh
- [x] Document configuration options
- [x] Specify output formatting rules

## Requirements
- Must follow existing TypeScript architecture patterns
- Integrate with layer-based component structure
- Support configuration for different use cases
- Provide clear visual documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Complete specification document created
- [x] PlantUML diagrams render without errors
- [x] Format supports both human and machine readability
- [x] Specification covers all edge cases
- [x] Integration patterns clearly defined
- [x] Configuration options documented

## Deliverables
1. `tree-index-specification.md` - Complete format and rules specification ✅
2. `tree-index-generator.puml` - Component architecture diagram ✅
3. `tree-index-workflow.puml` - Generation process flow diagram ✅

## Completed Deliverables
- [Tree Index Format Specification](../../../docs/tree-index-specification.md)
- [Component Architecture Diagram](../../../docs/puml/tree-index-generator.puml)
- [Workflow Diagram](../../../docs/puml/tree-index-workflow.puml)

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- All feedback and audit entries must be timestamped (UTC) and documented in this section.
- 2025-08-15 10:00 UTC: Architect specification completed with comprehensive format definition, component architecture, and workflow diagrams.
