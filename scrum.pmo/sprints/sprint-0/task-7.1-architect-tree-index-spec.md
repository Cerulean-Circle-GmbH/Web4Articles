# Task 7.1: Architect - Tree Index Specification

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] specification design
  - [ ] PUML diagrams
  - [ ] review
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
- Architect: Design the specification for tree.index.md files including format, structure, generation rules, and integration patterns. Create PlantUML diagrams showing the tree index generation workflow and component architecture.

## Context
- Tree index files will provide automated documentation of directory structures
- Must integrate with existing TypeScript tooling architecture
- Should follow CMM Level 4 principles for automated documentation
- Needs to support both manual and automated generation

## Intention
- Define clear specification for tree.index.md format
- Establish generation rules and filtering criteria
- Design component architecture for the generator
- Create visual documentation of the process flow

## Steps
- [ ] Define tree.index.md markdown format specification
- [ ] Specify filtering rules (what to include/exclude)
- [ ] Design TypeScript component architecture
- [ ] Create PlantUML diagram for generation workflow
- [ ] Define integration points with TSRanger/TSsh
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Specify output formatting rules

## Requirements
- Must follow existing TypeScript architecture patterns
- Integrate with layer-based component structure
- Support configuration for different use cases
- Provide clear visual documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete specification document created
- [ ] PlantUML diagrams render without errors
- [ ] Format supports both human and machine readability
- [ ] Specification covers all edge cases
- [ ] Integration patterns clearly defined
- [ ] Configuration options documented

## Deliverables
1. `tree-index-specification.md` - Complete format and rules specification
2. `tree-index-generator.puml` - Component architecture diagram
3. `tree-index-workflow.puml` - Generation process flow diagram

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- All feedback and audit entries must be timestamped (UTC) and documented in this section.
