# Task 7: Tree Index Documentation Process

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases
  - [ ] implementing
  - [ ] testing
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
- PO: Establish a standardized process for creating and maintaining tree.index.md files throughout the project. These files will provide automated documentation of directory structures, making project navigation and understanding easier for all team members.

## Context
- The tree.index.md concept was identified in the recovery system from cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu project
- Multiple PDCA entries show the use of `tree` command for structure visualization
- Need for standardized directory documentation across all project components
- Supports CMM Level 4 automated documentation and feedback loops

## Intention
- Create a reusable process for generating tree.index.md files
- Automate directory structure documentation
- Establish conventions for when and where tree.index.md files should be created
- Integrate with existing recovery and documentation processes

## Steps
- [ ] Architect creates specification for tree.index.md format and usage
- [ ] Developer implements TypeScript tree index generator tool
- [ ] Developer creates comprehensive tests for the generator
- [ ] PO documents the process and integration guidelines
- [ ] Update recovery process to include tree.index.md generation
- [ ] Add tree.index.md to component creation templates

## Requirements
- Tree index files must be in markdown format
- Generator must exclude common directories (node_modules, .git, dist)
- Support for depth limiting and file filtering
- Integration with existing TypeScript tooling
- Must work cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tree index generator creates valid markdown files
- [ ] Process documentation clearly explains when to use tree.index.md
- [ ] Generator is integrated into recovery process
- [ ] All major project directories have tree.index.md files
- [ ] Tool can be run via TSRanger/TSsh
- [ ] Automated tests cover all generator functionality

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- All feedback and audit entries must be timestamped (UTC) and documented in this section.
