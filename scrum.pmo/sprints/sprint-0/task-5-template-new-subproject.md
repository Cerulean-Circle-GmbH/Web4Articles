## Status

  - [ ] creating test cases

## Task Description
- PO: Document the steps required to set up a new subproject using this template project.

## Context
- The role derives the steps and understanding from the PO's task description and documents any additional context or constraints.

## Intention
- The PO double-checks that the role has captured the correct intent from the task description and context.

## Steps
- [x] Copy the template project structure.
- [x] Initialize a new git repository for the subproject.
- [x] Set up the SCRUM management structure and wiki as described above.
- [x] Update documentation and ontology for the new subproject.

## Requirements
- New subproject must be initialized with the correct structure and documentation.
- All steps must be clearly documented for future use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New subproject is initialized with the correct structure and documentation.
- All steps are clearly documented for future use.


## QA Audit & User Feedback
2025-08-03 UTC: QA: When running git operations for subproject or submodule creation, always verify you are in the correct project root directory (not a submodule or subfolder). Previous attempts committed in the wrong directory (wiki submodule) led to confusion and missed updates. This must be avoided in the future. Document this as a CMMI Level 4 improvement for constant process refinement.
