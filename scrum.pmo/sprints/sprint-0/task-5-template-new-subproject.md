## Task Description
- PO: Document the steps required to set up a new subproject using this template project.

## Context
- The role derives the steps and understanding from the PO's task description and documents any additional context or constraints.

## Intention
- The PO double-checks that the role has captured the correct intent from the task description and context.

## Steps
- [x] Copy the template project structure.
- [x] Initialize a new git repository for the subproject.
- [x] Set up the SCRUM management structure and wiki as described above.
- [x] Update documentation and ontology for the new subproject.

## Requirements
- New subproject must be initialized with the correct structure and documentation.
- All steps must be clearly documented for future use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New subproject is initialized with the correct structure and documentation.
- All steps are clearly documented for future use.


## QA Audit & User Feedback
- 2025-08-03 UTC: QA: A previous process overwrote the content of `/po/iteration-3-task-1.md`. This must be restored via git and such overwrites must be prevented in the future. Update process documentation to guarantee this learning. Tasks should be created in the correct sprint folder, not in /po.
