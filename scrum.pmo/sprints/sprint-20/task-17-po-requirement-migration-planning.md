# Task 17: PO - Requirement Component Migration to v0.3.0.4 Planning
[task:uuid:q8r9s0t1-u2v3-4567-qrst-u89012345678]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-17.1-po-requirement-migration-strategy.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases

## Traceability

```

## Task Description
Plan the migration of Requirement component to v0.3.0.4 following User/Unit patterns, as prerequisite for scenario format migration (Task 16).

## Context
From TRON Decision 2: Scenario migration requires Requirement component to be migrated to v0.3.0.4 first, so that recreated scenarios can use the new Requirement version. This must be planned correctly by PO before scenario migration can proceed.

## Intention
Plan the systematic migration of Requirement component from current version to v0.3.0.4 following the established User/Unit 0.3.0.4 patterns, enabling scenario migration to proceed with proper component versions.

## Steps
1. Analyze current Requirement component version and architecture
2. Plan migration strategy following User 0.3.0.4 and Unit 0.3.0.4 patterns
3. Define requirements for Requirement v0.3.0.4 compliance
4. Plan interface separation (one interface per file)
5. Plan Web4 compliance (empty constructor, scenario init, etc.)
6. Define acceptance criteria for Requirement v0.3.0.4
7. Schedule Requirement migration before scenario format migration

## Requirements
- Requirement component must follow User/Unit 0.3.0.4 patterns
- One interface per file compliance
- Web4 architectural principles (empty constructor, scenario initialization)
- Proper CLI implementation with scenario save/load
- Integration with central storage system
- Compatibility with existing requirement scenarios during transition

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current Requirement component analyzed and documented
- [ ] Migration strategy defined following User/Unit patterns
- [ ] Interface separation plan created (one interface per file)
- [ ] Web4 compliance requirements documented
- [ ] CLI implementation requirements specified
- [ ] Central storage integration requirements defined
- [ ] Migration timeline planned before Task 16 scenario migration
- [ ] Acceptance criteria for Requirement v0.3.0.4 defined

  ```quote
  2 see above, but it requires at first to migrate requiremen to v0.3.0.4 so postpone the migration to after this update happened any was planned correctly. add a task to plan this correctly for the PO.
  ```
  - [ ] Issue: Scenario migration requires Requirement v0.3.0.4 first
  - [ ] Resolution: Created PO task to plan Requirement migration correctly
  - [ ] Example: Plan Requirement v0.3.0.4 â†’ then proceed with scenario migration

## Dependencies
- Must be completed before Task 16 (Scenario Migration Strategy)
- Depends on User 0.3.0.4 and Unit 0.3.0.4 patterns as reference
- Blocks scenario format migration until Requirement v0.3.0.4 is available
