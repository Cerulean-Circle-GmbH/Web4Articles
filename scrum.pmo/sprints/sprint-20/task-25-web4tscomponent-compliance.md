# Task 25: Web4TSComponent Compliance and Dependency-Free Architecture 0.3.0.4
[task:uuid:y7z8a9b0-c1d2-3456-yzab-c78901234567]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-25.1-developer-web4tscomponent-compliance-assessment.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Assess Web4TSComponent for compliance violations and create clean dependency-free 0.3.0.4 version that builds itself while maintaining component folder creation, build standards, and tsconfig generation capabilities.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: Web4TSComponent works well but is partially Web4 non-compliant and needs minor rework for clean 0.3.0.4 version. It needs to build currently dependency-free itself as base component while maintaining its component generation functionality.

## Intention
Create Web4 compliant Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.4 that builds itself dependency-free while maintaining all component generation capabilities, establishing foundation for proper component creation standards in CLI ecosystem.

## Steps
1. Assess current Web4TSComponent for Web4 compliance violations
2. Document partial compliance issues and architectural problems
3. Create clean Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.4 with full compliance
4. Implement dependency-free architecture (builds itself without dependencies)
5. Maintain component folder creation capabilities
6. Preserve build standards and tsconfig generation functionality
7. Ensure version progression capabilities
8. Implement Web4 architectural patterns (empty constructor, scenario initialization)
9. Validate component generation functionality
10. Test dependency-free build and component creation workflow

## Requirements
- Web4TSComponent must be fully Web4 compliant (no partial compliance)
- Must build itself dependency-free as base component
- Component folder creation capabilities must be maintained
- Build standards and tsconfig generation must be preserved
- Version progression functionality must work correctly
- Web4 architectural patterns throughout (empty constructor, scenario initialization)
- Component generation standards must follow Web4 compliance
- Dependency-free architecture while maintaining full functionality
- Clean 0.3.0.4 version without compliance violations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current Web4TSComponent assessed for all compliance violations
- [ ] Partial compliance issues and architectural problems documented
- [ ] Clean Web4TSComponent 0.3.0.4 created with full Web4 compliance
- [ ] Dependency-free architecture implemented (builds itself without dependencies)
- [ ] Component folder creation capabilities maintained and functional
- [ ] Build standards and tsconfig generation preserved and working
- [ ] Version progression functionality validated
- [ ] Web4 architectural patterns implemented throughout
- [ ] Component generation standards follow Web4 compliance
- [ ] Clean 0.3.0.4 version tested and validated
- [ ] Dependency-free build workflow functional

- **Task 24 Integration:** [Build Progressive Dependency Resolution](./task-24-build-progressive-dependency-resolution.md) | [task-24-build-progressive-dependency-resolution.md](./task-24-build-progressive-dependency-resolution.md)

**Web4TSComponent Automation Requirements:**
- **Self-Building:** Must resolve its own dependencies automatically via Build system
- **Component Generation:** Must work without manual dependency building
- **Dependency Chain:** Automatically handle any component dependencies
- **Web4 Definition:** "When component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken"

## QA Audit & User Feedback

  ```quote
  the web4tscompunent was meant to create the component folders and build standards and tsconfigs and so on and progress versions. it also needs to build currently dependency free itself as a base component. it works well but it is itself partially web4 in-compliant and needs minor rework for a clean 0.3.0.4 version.
  
  - [ ] Issue: Web4TSComponent partially Web4 non-compliant, needs clean 0.3.0.4 version
  - [ ] Resolution: Assess compliance violations and create fully compliant dependency-free version
  - [ ] Functionality: Maintain component generation while achieving full Web4 compliance
  - [ ] **QA Specification Request:** Will request detailed specifications during PDCA work for compliance assessment and component generation standards

## Dependencies
- Independent base component (dependency-free)
- Foundation for proper component creation standards in CLI ecosystem
- Supports other CLI component generation and version management
