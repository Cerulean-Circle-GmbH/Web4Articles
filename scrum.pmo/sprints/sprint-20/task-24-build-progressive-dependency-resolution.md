# Task 24: Build System Progressive Dependency Resolution Enhancement
[task:uuid:x6y7z8a9-b0c1-2345-xyza-b67890123456]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-24.1-developer-progressive-dependency-resolution.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Enhance Build system with progressive dependency resolution for CLI ecosystem growth, handling transition from dependency-free components to DefaultCLI dependent components with lego-like composition architecture.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: As we progress, we create more dependencies that Build component has to handle and resolve - from dependency-free components to components using DefaultCLI. Need lego-like system with proper dependency management.

## Intention
Enable Build system to handle progressive dependency resolution as CLI ecosystem grows, supporting transition from dependency-free base components to interdependent CLI components with proper lego-like architecture.

## Steps
1. Enhance Build system dependency resolution for CLI ecosystem
2. Implement progressive dependency handling (dependency-free â†’ DefaultCLI dependent)
3. Create lego-like component composition system
4. Add CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution
5. Implement proper build order for interdependent CLI components
6. Create dependency chain validation and resolution
7. Enable component composition with proper dependency management
8. Validate progressive dependency resolution workflow
9. Test lego-like component architecture with Build system

## Requirements
- Build system must handle progressive dependency resolution
- Support transition from dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent components
- Lego-like component composition architecture
- CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution
- Proper build order for interdependent components
- Dependency chain validation and resolution
- Component composition with dependency management
- Progressive dependency handling as ecosystem grows
- Web4 compliance throughout dependency resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build system enhanced for progressive CLI ecosystem dependency resolution
- [ ] Dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent transition handling implemented
- [ ] Lego-like component composition system created
- [ ] CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution working
- [ ] Proper build order implemented for interdependent CLI components
- [ ] Dependency chain validation and resolution functional
- [ ] Component composition with dependency management tested
- [ ] Progressive dependency handling validated as ecosystem grows
- [ ] Web4 compliance maintained throughout dependency resolution

  ```
  - [ ] Issue: Build component needs progressive dependency resolution for growing CLI ecosystem
  - [ ] Resolution: Enhance Build system for dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent transition
  - [ ] Architecture: Lego-like component composition with proper dependency management
  - [ ] **QA Specification Request:** Will request detailed specifications during PDCA work for progressive dependency resolution

## Dependencies
- Depends on Task 21 (DefaultCLI Compliance) and Task 22 (UnitCLI Migration)
- Builds on Task 20 (Build Component Web4 Compliance)
- Foundation for scalable CLI ecosystem with proper dependency management
