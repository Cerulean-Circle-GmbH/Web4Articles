# Task 24: Build System Progressive Dependency Resolution Enhancement
[task:uuid:x6y7z8a9-b0c1-2345-xyza-b67890123456]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-24.1-developer-progressive-dependency-resolution.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress

## Task Description
Enhance Build system with progressive dependency resolution for CLI ecosystem growth, handling transition from dependency-free components to DefaultCLI dependent components with lego-like composition architecture.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: As we progress, we create more dependencies that Build component has to handle and resolve - from dependency-free components to components using DefaultCLI. Need lego-like system with proper dependency management.

## Intention
Enable Build system to handle progressive dependency resolution as CLI ecosystem grows, supporting transition from dependency-free base components to interdependent CLI components with proper lego-like architecture.

## Steps
1. Enhance Build system dependency resolution for CLI ecosystem
2. Implement progressive dependency handling (dependency-free → DefaultCLI dependent)
3. Create lego-like component composition system
4. Add CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution
5. Implement proper build order for interdependent CLI components
6. Create dependency chain validation and resolution
7. Enable component composition with proper dependency management
8. Validate progressive dependency resolution workflow
9. Test lego-like component architecture with Build system

## Requirements
- Build system must handle progressive dependency resolution
- Support transition from dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent components
- Lego-like component composition architecture
- CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution
- Proper build order for interdependent components
- Dependency chain validation and resolution
- Component composition with dependency management
- Progressive dependency handling as ecosystem grows
- Web4 compliance throughout dependency resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build system enhanced for progressive CLI ecosystem dependency resolution
- [ ] Dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent transition handling implemented
- [ ] Lego-like component composition system created
- [ ] CLI ecosystem specific dependency resolution working
- [ ] Proper build order implemented for interdependent CLI components
- [ ] Dependency chain validation and resolution functional
- [ ] Component composition with dependency management tested
- [ ] Progressive dependency handling validated as ecosystem grows
- [ ] Web4 compliance maintained throughout dependency resolution

## Automated Dependency Resolution Example

### **Manual Steps That Must Be Automated:**

**Web4Requirement Tool Dependency Resolution (Currently Manual - VIOLATION):**
```bash
# Step 1: Build Unit 0.1.0.0 dependency
cd components/Unit/0.1.0.0
npm install
npm run build
# Result: UnitIndexStorage.js created

# Step 2: Build User 0.1.0.0 dependency  
cd components/User/0.1.0.0
npm install
npm run build
# Result: DefaultUser.js created

# Step 3: Use Web4Requirement tool (now works)
components/Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2/requirement.sh create "CLI Color Coding Standards" "..."
# Result: Requirements created using proper tool (CMM3 compliant)
```

**Automated Build System Implementation (Required):**
```bash
# Single command should handle all dependencies automatically
components/Web4Requirement/0.1.2.2/requirement.sh create "CLI Color Coding Standards" "..."

# Build system automatically:
# 1. Detects Web4Requirement dependencies (Unit 0.1.0.0, User 0.1.0.0)
# 2. Builds Unit 0.1.0.0 if not available
# 3. Builds User 0.1.0.0 if not available  
# 4. Enables Web4Requirement tool execution
# 5. Creates requirement using proper tool (CMM3 compliant)
```

**Web4 Definition Compliance:**
- **Self-Building Components:** All components must resolve dependencies automatically
- **No Manual Intervention:** Tools should start without manual dependency building
- **Build System Integration:** Automated dependency detection and resolution
- **Broken Definition:** "When component is not doing it itself it is per Web4 definition not done or broken"

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-2115] TRON Requirements - Progressive Dependency Resolution
  ```quote
  as we are progressing we create more dependencies that the build component has to handle and resolve. from dependency free components to components using the defaultCLI.
  ```
  - [ ] Issue: Build component needs progressive dependency resolution for growing CLI ecosystem
  - [ ] Resolution: Enhance Build system for dependency-free to DefaultCLI dependent transition
  - [ ] Architecture: Lego-like component composition with proper dependency management
  - [ ] **QA Specification Request:** Will request detailed specifications during PDCA work for progressive dependency resolution

- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-2120] TRON Feedback - Build System Automation Violation
  ```quote
  all what you just did manually has to happen on starting any tool automatically done by the component itself using the build system. add this example to the task about the build system. with all detailed steps that you just did manual. reference it also as dual link in the web4tscomponent task. when the component is not doing it itself it is percweb4 definition not done or broken! pdca. refresh your mind about the decision process and reporting that you missuse again since a while.
  ```
  - [ ] Issue: Manual dependency resolution violates Web4 definition of self-building components
  - [ ] Resolution: Build system must automatically handle all dependency resolution steps
  - [ ] Example: Web4Requirement tool dependency chain (Unit 0.1.0.0 → User 0.1.0.0 → Web4Requirement)
  - [ ] Violation: Components not self-building are broken per Web4 definition

## Dependencies
- Depends on Task 21 (DefaultCLI Compliance) and Task 22 (UnitCLI Migration)
- Builds on Task 20 (Build Component Web4 Compliance)
- Foundation for scalable CLI ecosystem with proper dependency management
