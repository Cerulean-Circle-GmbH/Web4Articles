# Task 9: Scenario Format Compliance Implementation
[task:uuid:h8i9j0k1-l2m3-4567-hijk-l89012345678]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-9.1-developer-scenario-format.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

```

## Task Description
Fix scenario format compliance violations identified in session overview: UUIDv4 enforcement, correct scenario directory location, and encrypted owner implementation.

## Context
From Session Overview Analysis, TRON's unexecuted requirements:
"the scenario directory is ok but in the wrong base location. it should be in the scenario folder in the project root. The current new scenario format is the whole reason for the new version. still the uuid is ALWAYS a UUIDv4 â€¦ currently its not. the owner part is ALWAYS coming encrypted (currently only base64 encoded) from the user component."

## Intention
Ensure all scenarios follow proper Web4 format with UUIDv4 compliance, correct directory structure, and encrypted owner data for security and consistency.

## Steps
1. Enforce UUIDv4 format for all scenario UUIDs
2. Move scenarios to correct project root scenario directory
3. Implement proper owner encryption (not just base64 encoding)
4. Update all components to use compliant scenario format
5. Validate scenario format consistency across ecosystem
6. Test scenario save/load with new format

## Requirements
- All scenario UUIDs must be valid UUIDv4 format
- Scenarios must be stored in project root scenarios/ directory
- Owner data must be properly encrypted, not just base64 encoded
- All components must use consistent scenario format
- Scenario format compliance must be testable and validated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All scenario UUIDs are valid UUIDv4 format
- [ ] Scenarios stored in /workspace/scenarios/ directory structure
- [ ] Owner data properly encrypted using secure encryption
- [ ] User 0.3.0.4 scenario format updated to compliance standard
- [ ] All components use consistent scenario format
- [ ] Scenario format validation tests implemented
- [ ] Save/load functionality works with compliant format
- [ ] No base64-only encoding for owner data

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Issue: Scenario format violations break ecosystem consistency
  - [ ] Resolution: Proper UUIDv4, directory structure, and encryption
  - [ ] Example: Scenarios in project root with encrypted owners
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] Feedback to be collected after subtask completion.
  - [ ] Issue: Security and format compliance validation
  - [ ] Resolution: Verify proper encryption and UUIDv4 format
  - [ ] Example: All scenarios follow consistent Web4 format standard
