# Task 2: PDCA Search Integration System
[task:uuid:5df36f06-b702-438b-b562-725113c83962]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-2.1-developer-search-engine.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive PDCA search and discovery system to improve accessibility of the 18+ process improvement documents and distributed PDCA files across the project. This addresses the identified gap in PDCA document organization and discoverability.

## Context
Current PDCA discovery challenges:
1. **Scattered Documentation**: 18+ improvement files in pdca.process.improvements/
2. **Manual Navigation**: No search capability across PDCA documents
3. **Limited Discovery**: Difficult to find relevant PDCAs by topic/date/role
4. **Cross-Reference Gaps**: No systematic way to find related PDCAs
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Process improvements not easily discoverable

The existing symbolic link system (16/16 working links) provides centralization but lacks search functionality.

## Intention
Create comprehensive PDCA search system to:
- Enable full-text search across all PDCA documentation
- Provide semantic search by topic, role, and process area
- Improve discoverability of process improvements and lessons learned
- Create cross-reference discovery for related PDCA cycles
- Reduce time to find relevant PDCA documentation from 10+ minutes to <1 minute

## Steps
1. **Search Engine Architecture** (Developer)
   - Design search indexing system for PDCA documents
   - Plan full-text and metadata search capabilities
   - Define search result ranking and relevance algorithms

2. **Discovery Interface Implementation** (Developer)
   - Create CLI/web interface for PDCA search
   - Implement filters by date, role, topic, process area
   - Add cross-reference discovery and relationship mapping
   - Integrate with existing symbolic link system

3. **Search System Validation** (Tester)
   - Create test cases for search accuracy and completeness
   - Validate cross-reference discovery functionality
   - Test performance with full PDCA document corpus
   - Verify integration with existing PDCA workflow

## Requirements
- Full-text search across all PDCA markdown files
- Metadata search by date, role, agent, topic, process area
- Cross-reference discovery (related PDCAs, improvement chains)
- Integration with existing pdca.process.improvements/ symbolic links
- CLI interface compatible with current development workflow
- Search result ranking by relevance and recency
- Support for semantic search (similar topics, related processes)
- Performance optimized for 100+ PDCA documents
- Integration with existing git-based PDCA workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full-text search across all PDCA documents in project
- [ ] Metadata filtering by date, role, agent, topic, process area
- [ ] Cross-reference discovery showing related PDCA cycles
- [ ] Search results ranked by relevance and recency
- [ ] CLI interface with intuitive search syntax
- [ ] Integration with existing symbolic link system (18+ improvement docs)
- [ ] Search performance under 2 seconds for full corpus
- [ ] Semantic search capability for related topics/processes
- [ ] Search result display includes GitHub and local dual links
- [ ] Documentation includes search syntax and usage examples
- [ ] Reduces PDCA discovery time from 10+ minutes to under 1 minute
- [ ] Supports incremental search as new PDCAs are created

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Search accuracy and completeness validation
  - [ ] Performance testing with full document corpus
  - [ ] Integration testing with existing workflow
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] Feedback to be collected after subtask completion.
