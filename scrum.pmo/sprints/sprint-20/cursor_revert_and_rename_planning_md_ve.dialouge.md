**User**

between commit 21cc292 and dfc1b12 the file /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/planning.md was multiple times changed and overwritten. just revoce all the versions. from git as planning.01.md, planning02.md,...

**Cursor**

I'll help you recover all versions of the `planning.md` file between commits 21cc292 and dfc1b12. Let me first examine the git history for this specific file and then extract each version.

Now let me extract each version of the planning.md file from these commits and save them as numbered files. I'll start with the oldest version first:

Let me also provide you with a summary of what each version represents:

Perfect! I've successfully recovered all versions of the `planning.md` file that were changed between commits 21cc292 and dfc1b12. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary

**6 versions recovered and saved as:**
- `planning.01.md` (13,703 bytes) - Initial Sprint 20 planning with Web4 methodology 
- `planning.02.md` (19,234 bytes) - Added PDCA Object Architecture Recognition
- `planning.03.md` (20,684 bytes) - PDCA-Git Component Integration added
- `planning.04.md` (20,739 bytes) - Web4 Constructor Pattern updates
- `planning.05.md` (22,452 bytes) - Scenario Model Implementation EPIC added
- `planning.06.md` (24,017 bytes) - IOR Distributed References implementation
- `planning.md` (37,862 bytes) - Current version (much larger, likely significant changes)

## Version Timeline (chronological order)
1. **planning.01.md** (`df9eda4`) - Sprint 20 Planning: Web4 methodology implementation with 7-layer architecture
2. **planning.02.md** (`216c8dd`) - PDCA Object Architecture Recognition with Plan/Do/Check/Act scenario trees  
3. **planning.03.md** (`ce74cf3`) - PDCA-Git Component Integration for git operations
4. **planning.04.md** (`bb3cda3`) - Web4 Constructor Pattern with scenario initialization
5. **planning.05.md** (`1d12e0d`) - Scenario Model Implementation EPIC with MVC architecture
6. **planning.06.md** (`2d8b3e8`) - IOR Distributed References with cross-network object resolution

All versions have been saved in the `scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/` directory and are ready for review. You can see the evolution of the planning document through these 6 iterations, with the file size growing from ~14KB to ~24KB as more architectural concepts and implementation details were added.
