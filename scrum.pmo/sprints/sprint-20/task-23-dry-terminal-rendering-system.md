# Task 23: DRY Terminal Rendering System in DefaultCLI with Color Coding Standards
[task:uuid:w5x6y7z8-a9b0-1234-wxyz-a56789012345]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-23.1-developer-terminal-rendering-centralization.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases

## Task Description
Centralize terminal rendering system in DefaultCLI with requirement-v0.1.2.2 color coding standards, eliminating duplication across CLI components and establishing DRY terminal view rendering for Web4 ecosystem.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: All terminal rendering should go into DefaultCLI so that UnitCLI can pick from it and keep up DRY. UnitCLI does not maintain correct color coding as in requirement-v0.1.2.2 which is default for usage views in format sections and color encoding.

## Intention
Create centralized terminal rendering system in DefaultCLI with proper color coding standards, enabling all CLI components to use DRY terminal rendering and maintaining consistent format sections and color encoding across Web4 ecosystem.

## Steps
1. Centralize all terminal rendering functionality in DefaultCLI
2. Implement requirement-v0.1.2.2 color coding standards
3. Create DRY usage view format system with standard sections
4. Implement color encoding for different UI elements (headers, commands, parameters, examples)
5. Create terminal view rendering methods for component info display
6. Establish format standards for usage views across all components
7. Enable CLI component inheritance of terminal rendering capabilities
8. Remove duplicate terminal rendering from all CLI components
9. Validate DRY compliance and color coding standards
10. Test terminal rendering across all CLI components

## Requirements
- All terminal rendering functionality centralized in DefaultCLI
- requirement-v0.1.2.2 color coding standards implemented
- DRY compliance across all CLI components (no terminal rendering duplication)
- Standard format sections for usage views (Usage, Commands, Parameters, Examples, Web4 Integration)
- Color encoding for UI elements (cyan for commands, yellow for parameters, green for descriptions)
- Terminal view rendering for component info display
- CLI component inheritance of terminal rendering capabilities
- Consistent color coding across entire Web4 ecosystem
- Format standards applied to all existing and future CLI components

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All terminal rendering functionality centralized in DefaultCLI
- [ ] requirement-v0.1.2.2 color coding standards implemented and documented
- [ ] DRY compliance achieved (no terminal rendering duplication across components)
- [ ] Standard format sections implemented for usage views
- [ ] Color encoding implemented for all UI elements
- [ ] Terminal view rendering methods created for component info display
- [ ] CLI component inheritance of terminal rendering enabled
- [ ] All existing CLI components migrated to use DefaultCLI terminal rendering
- [ ] Consistent color coding validated across Web4 ecosystem
- [ ] Format standards applied and tested across all components

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-2115] TRON Requirements - DRY Terminal Rendering System
  ```quote
  the unitcli does not maintain the correct color coding as in requirement 0.1.2.2 which is the default for usage views in format sections and color encoding. all these terminal rendering will be going into the defaultcli, so that the unitcli can pick from it and keep up the DRY.
  ```
  - [ ] Issue: UnitCLI has incorrect color coding and duplicate terminal rendering
  - [ ] Resolution: Centralize terminal rendering in DefaultCLI with requirement-v0.1.2.2 standards
  - [ ] DRY Implementation: All CLI components use DefaultCLI terminal rendering
  - [ ] **QA Specification Request:** Will request detailed specifications during PDCA work for terminal rendering centralization

## Dependencies
- Depends on Task 21 (DefaultCLI Web4 Compliance) completion
- Depends on Task 22 (UnitCLI Migration) for inheritance implementation
- Foundation for consistent terminal rendering across all CLI components
