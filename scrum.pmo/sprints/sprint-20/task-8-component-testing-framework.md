# Task 8: Component Testing Framework Implementation
[task:uuid:g7h8i9j0-k1l2-3456-ghij-k78901234567]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-8.1-developer-vitest-setup.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive testing framework for all components with Vitest, create test cases for component building and starting, and externalize repeated CLI patterns following DRY principle.

## Context
From Session Overview Analysis, TRON's unexecuted requirements:
"add testcases for each component starter to start from scratch and clean build. each component shall display the usage after build, as it is called without parameters. review DRY and externalize all what repeats eg cli colors."

## Intention
Create systematic testing framework that validates each component can start from scratch, build cleanly, and display usage, while eliminating DRY violations in CLI implementations.

## Steps
1. Set up Vitest testing framework for all components
2. Create test cases for each component clean build process
3. Create test cases for component usage display functionality
4. Externalize repeated CLI patterns (colors, formatting) to shared library
5. Implement static start methods instead of functional entry points
6. Validate all components follow consistent testing patterns

## Requirements
- Vitest testing framework setup in all 0.3.0.2+ components
- Test cases for clean build process for each component
- Test cases for usage display when called without parameters
- Shared CLI library for colors and formatting (DRY compliance)
- Static start methods instead of main() functions
- All tests must pass for component compliance validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 0.3.0.2+ components have Vitest testing setup
- [ ] Each component has test case for clean build from scratch
- [ ] Each component has test case for usage display without parameters
- [ ] Shared CLI library implemented with colors and formatting
- [ ] All CLI implementations use shared library (no duplication)
- [ ] Static start methods implemented in all components
- [ ] All component tests pass consistently
- [ ] Testing framework enables systematic component validation

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Issue: No systematic testing of component build and start processes
  - [ ] Resolution: Comprehensive Vitest framework with clean build validation
  - [ ] Example: Each component tested for scratch build and usage display
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] Feedback to be collected after subtask completion.
  - [ ] Issue: DRY violations in CLI implementations
  - [ ] Resolution: Shared CLI library eliminates code duplication
  - [ ] Example: Consistent color and formatting across all components
