# Task 7: Implement Seamless ONCE Build Chain
[task:uuid:f6g7h8i9-j0k1-2345-fghi-j67890123456]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-7.1-developer-build-chain.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status

## Task Description
Implement seamless ONCE build chain where typing "once" automatically builds all dependencies in correct order until CLI shows usage. This addresses TRON's requirement: "the core component that needs to build seamlessly from scratch in an empty background agent is once."

## Context
From Session Overview Analysis, TRON's unexecuted requirement:
"typing 'once' should seamlessly execute the build chain. add a testcase for that as the first testcase. stop testing if it fails and fix that first. add a npm run clean to reset the build files and be able to test clean. each component shall display the usage after build, as it is called without parameters."

## Intention
Create fully automated build chain that enables seamless ONCE execution from empty environment, following proper dependency resolution without bypasses or shortcuts.

## Steps
1. Implement automatic dependency detection and build ordering
2. Add npm run clean commands to all components for clean testing
3. Create seamless build chain that builds all dependencies automatically
4. Implement static start methods instead of functional entry points
5. Add first testcase for seamless ONCE execution
6. Ensure each component displays usage when called without parameters

## Requirements
- Typing "once" must automatically build all dependencies in correct order
- Each component must have npm run clean command
- All components must display usage when called without parameters
- Static start methods instead of functional main() methods
- First testcase must validate seamless ONCE execution
- Build chain must work from completely empty environment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "once" command automatically builds IOR, Build, Scenario, User dependencies
- [ ] All components have npm run clean command implemented
- [ ] ONCE CLI shows usage after successful build chain execution
- [ ] All components display usage when called without parameters
- [ ] Static start methods implemented instead of functional entry points
- [ ] First testcase validates seamless build chain execution
- [ ] Build chain works from empty background agent environment
- [ ] No manual dependency building required

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Issue: Manual dependency building violates seamless execution requirement
  - [ ] Resolution: Automated build chain with proper dependency resolution
  - [ ] Example: "once" command works from empty environment
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] Feedback to be collected after subtask completion.
  - [ ] Issue: Build chain automation and component integration
  - [ ] Resolution: Verify seamless execution without manual intervention
  - [ ] Example: Complete build chain from dependency-free to ONCE CLI usage
