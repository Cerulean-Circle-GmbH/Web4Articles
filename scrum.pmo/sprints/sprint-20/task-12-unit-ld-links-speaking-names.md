# Task 12: Implement Unit LD Links Speaking Name Resolution System
[task:uuid:k1l2m3n4-o5p6-7890-klmn-o12345678901]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-12.1-developer-speaking-name-resolution.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Task Description
Implement Unit LD Links system that enables speaking name resolution to UUID storage locations, preventing inconsistency and bad redundancy by mapping human-readable names to unique identified units in central storage.

## Context
From TRON feedback: "the unit track the ld links to the central uuid storage. the ld link can have speaking names but always go to a unique identified unit in the storage, so prevent inconsistency and bad redundancy."

Current state: UnitIndexStorage exists but Unit component doesn't provide speaking name resolution interface for other components to use.

## Intention
Enable human-readable names (like "user-alice" or "server-main") to map to unique UUIDs in central storage, preventing naming conflicts and enabling consistent reference across the ecosystem while maintaining central storage integrity.

## Steps
1. Implement speaking name resolution methods in Unit component
2. Create LD links management system for symbolic link tracking
3. Enable speaking name registration and lookup functionality
4. Implement conflict prevention for duplicate speaking names
5. Provide API for other components to use speaking names
6. Test speaking name resolution with existing storage system

## Requirements
- Speaking names must map to unique UUIDs in central storage
- Prevent multiple speaking names pointing to same UUID
- Prevent same speaking name pointing to different UUIDs
- All components can use speaking name resolution via Unit API
- Speaking names resolve to proper scenarios/index/ storage locations
- LD links tracking maintains symbolic link integrity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Speaking name resolution API implemented in Unit component
- [ ] Speaking names map uniquely to UUID storage locations
- [ ] Conflict prevention for duplicate names implemented
- [ ] LD links management tracks all symbolic links properly
- [ ] Other components can register and resolve speaking names
- [ ] Speaking name resolution works with existing scenarios/index/ system
- [ ] No inconsistency or bad redundancy in name mapping
- [ ] All speaking names resolve to unique identified units
- [ ] **Scripts Integration (QA Feedback):**
  - [ ] Unit link created in scripts directory
  - [ ] Version link created in scripts/versions for Unit 0.3.0.4

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0830] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Issue: Speaking names must prevent inconsistency and redundancy
  - [ ] Resolution: Unique mapping to central UUID storage
  - [ ] Example: "user-alice" always maps to same UUID, prevents conflicts
- [x] [2025-09-06-UTC-0910] TRON QA Feedback collected.
  - [x] Issue: "i did not see a unit link in scripts nor a new version link"
  - [x] Resolution: Add unit link in scripts directory and version link in scripts/versions
  - [x] Example: scripts/unit and scripts/versions/unit-v0.3.0.4 created
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0920] TRON QA Feedback collected.
  - [ ] Issue: "i expect a ln link in the temp folder and a new unit in the index as uuid.scenario.json and the ln link pointing to it with the file name test-unit as you named it in your testcase. cannot see anything like that."
  - [ ] Resolution: Implement proper LD links creation in temp folder pointing to scenarios/index/ storage
  - [ ] Example: temp/test-unit -> scenarios/index/a/b/c/d/e/[uuid].scenario.json
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0925] TRON QA Feedback collected.
  - [ ] Issue: "we are in radical oop most modern typescript. read the tech stack again . there was never room for a js require() … add this feedback quoted to the task as my previous feedback."
  - [ ] Resolution: Fix require() usage with modern ESM imports, use dynamic imports and proper TypeScript patterns
  - [ ] Example: Replace require('fs') with import('fs') and fix all CJS violations
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0930] TRON QA Feedback collected.
  - [ ] Issue: "do not fix or bypass std esm modules with shit. just do proper modern typescript and nothing else!!!"
  - [ ] Resolution: Use proper modern TypeScript ESM patterns only, no require(), no bypasses, no shit
  - [ ] Example: Standard ESM imports and modern TypeScript patterns throughout
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0935] TRON QA Feedback collected.
  - [ ] Issue: "you do not use the decisions. you decide shit on your own and i have to forcefully stop you. understand decisions and use them. review the component for web2 shit and report all."
  - [ ] Resolution: Use provided decisions (1a, 2a, 3b), stop making independent decisions, review Unit component for Web2 violations
  - [ ] Example: Follow decision 1a (copy UnitIndexStorage), 2a (speaking names in DefaultUnit), 3b (isolated testing)
  
### **QA Section Response to TRON Feedback:**

**Issue 1 - Missing LD Links and Storage Integration:**
Following decisions 1a, 2a, 3b - Unit component missing proper LD links and storage integration.

**Issue 2 - Web2 Violations Found in Unit Component:**
- **btoa() usage:** [DefaultUnit.ts:79](../../../../components/Unit/0.3.0.4/src/ts/layer2/DefaultUnit.ts) - Web2 base64 encoding instead of modern crypto
- **Dual Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/once0304/components/Unit/0.3.0.4/src/ts/layer2/DefaultUnit.ts) | [components/Unit/0.3.0.4/src/ts/layer2/DefaultUnit.ts](../../../../components/Unit/0.3.0.4/src/ts/layer2/DefaultUnit.ts)

**Issue 3 - Decision Compliance Failure:**
Not following provided decisions:
- Decision 1a: Copy UnitIndexStorage ✅ DONE
- Decision 2a: Speaking names in DefaultUnit ✅ DONE  
- Decision 3b: Isolated testing ❌ NOT FOLLOWED - tried to implement without testing first

**Resolution Required:**
- Remove btoa() Web2 shit, use modern TypeScript crypto
- Follow decision 3b: Create isolated testing environment
- Use only provided decisions, stop independent decision-making
