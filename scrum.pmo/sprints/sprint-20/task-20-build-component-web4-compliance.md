# Task 20: Build Component Web4 Compliance Assessment and Version 0.3.0.4
[task:uuid:t2u3v4w5-x6y7-8901-tuvw-x23456789012]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-20.1-developer-build-compliance-assessment.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned

## Task Description
Assess current Build component for Web4 compliance violations and create compliant Build 0.3.0.4 following Unit/DefaultCLI patterns with proper dependency resolution before usage display - no bypasses, shortcuts, or simpler approaches.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: Build component should help resolve dependencies on starting and building tools (e.g., unit) before showing usage as proof of working correctly. Must follow same Web4 compliance patterns as Unit with DefaultCLI integration - no bypasses, shortcuts, or new simpler approaches.

## Intention
Create Web4 compliant Build component 0.3.0.4 that properly resolves dependencies and validates working state before showing usage, following proven Unit/DefaultCLI patterns without any compliance violations or shortcuts.

## Steps
1. Assess current Build component for Web4 compliance violations
2. Document all bypasses, shortcuts, and non-compliant approaches
3. Analyze current dependency resolution vs proper Web4 patterns
4. Design Build 0.3.0.4 following Unit 0.3.0.4 compliance patterns:
   - Empty constructor + scenario initialization
   - DefaultCLI integration for command handling
   - Terminal identity support (if applicable)
   - Proper dependency resolution without bypasses
5. Implement dependency resolution that validates working state before usage
6. Integrate DefaultCLI base component for CLI functionality
7. Ensure Build component resolves dependencies for tools (e.g., unit) before showing usage
8. Validate no bypasses, shortcuts, or compliance violations remain
9. Test complete dependency resolution workflow

## Requirements
- Build component must follow Web4 architectural principles (empty constructor, scenario initialization)
- Must integrate DefaultCLI base component for CLI functionality
- Must resolve dependencies before showing usage as proof of working correctly
- No bypasses, shortcuts, or simpler approaches allowed - pure Web4 compliance
- Must follow Unit 0.3.0.4 and DefaultCLI 0.3.0.4 patterns exactly
- Dependency resolution must validate working state before usage display
- Must handle tool dependency resolution (e.g., unit component dependencies)
- All compliance violations from current Build component must be eliminated
- Build 0.3.0.4 must demonstrate proper Web4 compliance throughout

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current Build component assessed for all Web4 compliance violations
- [ ] All bypasses, shortcuts, and non-compliant approaches documented
- [ ] Build 0.3.0.4 created following Unit 0.3.0.4 compliance patterns
- [ ] Empty constructor + scenario initialization pattern implemented
- [ ] DefaultCLI integration completed for command handling
- [ ] Dependency resolution implemented without bypasses or shortcuts
- [ ] Build resolves tool dependencies before showing usage (proof of working state)
- [ ] No compliance violations remain in Build 0.3.0.4
- [ ] Complete dependency resolution workflow tested and validated
- [ ] Build component demonstrates pure Web4 compliance
- [ ] Integration with existing ecosystem (Unit, DefaultCLI) working properly

## Example Build Component Usage

### **Web4 Compliant Build 0.3.0.4 Pattern:**

```bash
# Build component resolves dependencies before showing usage
build

# Dependency resolution output:
ðŸ”§ Resolving dependencies...
âœ… Unit 0.3.0.4: Dependencies resolved, build successful
âœ… DefaultCLI 0.3.0.4: Base component ready
âœ… All dependencies validated and working

# Then shows usage (proof of working state):
Web4 Build CLI Tool v0.3.0.4 - Dependency Resolution and Build Management

Usage:
  build resolve <component>                       # Resolve component dependencies
  build validate <component>                      # Validate component build state
  build clean <component>                         # Clean component build artifacts
  build info                                      # Show build system info
  build help                                      # Show this help

Commands:
  resolve      Resolve and build component dependencies
  validate     Validate component is properly built and functional
  clean        Clean build artifacts and reset component state
  info         Display build system information and status
  help         Show this help message

Examples:
  build resolve unit                              # Resolve Unit component dependencies
  build validate unit                             # Validate Unit component working state
  build clean unit                                # Clean Unit component build


### **Dependency Resolution Flow:**
1. **Pre-Usage Validation:** Build component validates its own dependencies first
2. **Tool Dependency Resolution:** Resolves dependencies for requested tools (e.g., unit)
3. **Working State Proof:** Demonstrates tools are working correctly
4. **Usage Display:** Shows usage only after proving working state
5. **No Bypasses:** Complete Web4 compliance throughout process

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-2045] TRON Requirements - Build Component Web4 Compliance
  ```quote
  - [ ] now you understood how to build DefaultCLI and use it in Unit. thats how the Build component should help to resolve dependencies on starting and building the too (e.g unit) before showing the usage as a proof that its working correctly. no bypass, no shortcut, no new simpler approach, just web4 compliance!!!! create a task for the build component to be assessed for web4 compliance and have a compliant version 0.3.0.4.
  
  - [ ] Issue: Build component needs Web4 compliance assessment and proper dependency resolution
  - [ ] Resolution: Create Task 20 for Build component compliance assessment and version 0.3.0.4
  - [ ] Pattern: Follow Unit/DefaultCLI patterns with dependency resolution before usage
  - [ ] Compliance: No bypasses, shortcuts, or simpler approaches - pure Web4 compliance

## Dependencies
- Builds on successful Unit 0.3.0.4 and DefaultCLI 0.3.0.4 patterns
- Requires DefaultCLI base component for CLI integration
- Must integrate with existing ecosystem (Unit, User, etc.)
- Foundation for proper dependency resolution throughout Web4 ecosystem
