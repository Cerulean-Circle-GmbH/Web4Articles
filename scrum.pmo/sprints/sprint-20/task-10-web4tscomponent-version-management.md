# Task 10: Web4TSComponent Version Management Implementation
[task:uuid:i9j0k1l2-m3n4-5678-ijkl-m90123456789]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-10.1-developer-version-tracking.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress

## Task Description
Implement Web4TSComponent version management methods that were planned but never executed, enabling proper component versioning, lifecycle management, and upgrade patterns.

## Context
From Build System Progress PDCA, planned but never implemented:
"Implement Web4TSComponent version management methods" was identified as pending task that would enable proper component version tracking and lifecycle management across the ecosystem.

## Intention
Complete the Web4TSComponent foundation that enables systematic version management, component lifecycle tracking, and upgrade patterns for the entire component ecosystem.

## Steps
1. Implement Web4TSComponent base class with version management
2. Add component lifecycle management methods
3. Implement version comparison and upgrade patterns
4. Add component dependency tracking
5. Create version validation and compatibility checking
6. Test version management across component ecosystem

## Requirements
- Web4TSComponent base class with version management methods
- Component lifecycle management (install, start, stop, uninstall)
- Version comparison and upgrade pattern implementation
- Component dependency tracking and validation
- Version compatibility checking across ecosystem
- All components must extend Web4TSComponent for consistency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Web4TSComponent base class implemented with version methods
- [ ] Component lifecycle management methods functional
- [ ] Version comparison and upgrade patterns working
- [ ] Component dependency tracking implemented
- [ ] Version compatibility checking validates ecosystem consistency
- [ ] All 0.3.0.2+ components extend Web4TSComponent
- [ ] Version management enables systematic component upgrades
- [ ] Component lifecycle methods enable proper start/stop/install/uninstall

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] QA review pending.
  - [ ] Issue: No systematic component version management
  - [ ] Resolution: Web4TSComponent base class with version methods
  - [ ] Example: Components track versions and dependencies systematically
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-0740] Feedback to be collected after subtask completion.
  - [ ] Issue: Component lifecycle and upgrade management
  - [ ] Resolution: Verify proper version management functionality
  - [ ] Example: Components can be upgraded and managed systematically
