# Task 22: UnitCLI Migration to Extend DefaultCLI with Terminal Rendering
[task:uuid:v4w5x6y7-z8a9-0123-vwxy-z45678901234]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-22.1-developer-unitcli-inheritance-migration.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement

## Task Description
Migrate UnitCLI to extend DefaultCLI with proper inheritance, DRY terminal rendering, and requirement-v0.1.2.2 color coding standards for Web4 compliant CLI architecture.

## Context
From TRON Requirements: UnitCLI should extend DefaultCLI where coloring is set. Info in UnitCLI is basically terminal view for Unit component. Console log is terminal view rendering that should be centralized in DefaultCLI for DRY compliance.

## Intention
Transform UnitCLI from standalone CLI to proper DefaultCLI extension with centralized terminal rendering, eliminating code duplication and establishing proper CLI inheritance patterns for Web4 ecosystem.

## Steps
1. Migrate UnitCLI to extend DefaultCLI instead of standalone implementation
2. Remove duplicate terminal rendering code from UnitCLI
3. Integrate DefaultCLI color coding system for requirement-v0.1.2.2 compliance
4. Migrate info command to use DefaultCLI terminal view rendering
5. Implement proper inheritance patterns for CLI functionality
6. Remove custom color coding in favor of DefaultCLI standards
7. Ensure DRY compliance by using DefaultCLI terminal rendering
8. Validate UnitCLI inheritance and functionality
9. Test all CLI commands with DefaultCLI integration

## Requirements
- UnitCLI must extend DefaultCLI instead of standalone implementation
- All terminal rendering must use DefaultCLI DRY system (no duplicate code)
- Color coding must follow requirement-v0.1.2.2 standards from DefaultCLI
- Info command must be terminal view rendering for Unit component
- Console log output must use DefaultCLI terminal view rendering
- Proper inheritance patterns for CLI functionality
- DRY compliance throughout UnitCLI implementation
- All existing CLI functionality must be preserved during migration
- Web4 compliance maintained throughout inheritance migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UnitCLI extends DefaultCLI with proper inheritance patterns
- [ ] All duplicate terminal rendering code removed from UnitCLI
- [ ] DefaultCLI color coding system integrated for requirement-v0.1.2.2 compliance
- [ ] Info command migrated to DefaultCLI terminal view rendering
- [ ] Console log output uses DefaultCLI terminal view rendering
- [ ] DRY compliance achieved (no terminal rendering duplication)
- [ ] All existing CLI functionality preserved during migration
- [ ] UnitCLI inheritance and functionality validated
- [ ] CLI commands tested with DefaultCLI integration
- [ ] Web4 compliance maintained throughout migration

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [2025-09-06-UTC-2115] TRON Requirements - UnitCLI DefaultCLI Migration
  ```quote
  the unitcli should extend the defaultCli where the coloring is set. the info in the unitcli is basically a terminal view for the unit component. create a task to migrate that and give you the specification when we arrive working on that task. your console log is basically a terminal view rendering.
  
  - [ ] Issue: UnitCLI should extend DefaultCLI instead of standalone implementation
  - [ ] Resolution: Migrate UnitCLI to proper DefaultCLI inheritance with terminal view rendering
  - [ ] Specification: Terminal view for Unit component using DefaultCLI rendering system
  - [ ] **QA Specification Request:** Will request detailed specifications during PDCA work for terminal view migration

## Dependencies
- Depends on Task 21 (DefaultCLI Web4 Compliance) completion
- Prerequisite for Task 23 (DRY Terminal Rendering System)
- Foundation for proper CLI inheritance patterns in Web4 ecosystem
