- Plan: Fix g[tab] method-sync on Down; ensure Methods header shows (c) after typing c.
- Do: Adjust v2 controller to sync prompt token on method navigation and to set method filter on typing; rerun tests with TSRANGER_V2=1.
- Check: Run full test suite (non-interactive).
- Act: Apply mitigations found in Check; commit and push after run.

## 2025-08-09T17:59:22Z
- Do: Keep Methods filter/selection when class unchanged; updated deriveFiltersFromPrompt to avoid resetting on each prompt recompute.

## 2025-08-09T18:03:32Z
- Do: DeterministicTestIO.clear drops earlier frames when TS_RANGER_TEST_FINAL_ONLY=1 for stable final frame assertions.

## 2025-08-09T18:03:58Z
- Do: Sync prompt on Methods Down after g[tab]; show Methods header filter on typing method token; refine final-only frame clearing.

## 2025-08-09T18:36:47Z
- Do: Add optional v2 activation log (stderr) gated by TSRANGER_V2_LOG=1 to confirm src.v2 is executed during tests without altering assertions.
