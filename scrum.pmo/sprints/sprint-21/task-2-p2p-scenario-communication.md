## Task Description
Implement P2P scenario communication system for ONCE kernels to exchange scenarios and enable distributed "com-unique-action" coordination across Web4 network.

## Context
Web4 architecture requires distributed object communication via scenario exchange. ONCE kernels must communicate with each other to share component instances, coordinate workflows, and enable network-wide Web4 object collaboration.

## Intention
Build production-ready P2P communication engine that enables ONCE kernels to exchange scenarios securely and efficiently, providing the foundation for distributed Web4 component coordination.

## Steps
1. **Protocol Design**: Architect P2P communication protocol for scenario exchange
2. **Exchange Implementation**: Build scenario serialization and network transfer system
3. **Communication Testing**: Validate P2P functionality across network boundaries

## Requirements
- P2P connection establishment between ONCE kernels
- Scenario serialization/deserialization for network transfer
- Com-unique-action execution pattern implementation
- Distributed coordination via scenario communication
- Network security and authentication for P2P connections

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **P2P Connection**: Kernel-to-kernel connection establishment functional
- [ ] **Scenario Exchange**: Reliable scenario transfer between remote kernels
- [ ] **Serialization**: Complete scenario hibernation/restoration across network
- [ ] **Com-Unique-Action**: Communication + Unique + Action pattern implemented
- [ ] **Network Security**: Authenticated and encrypted P2P connections
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust network error recovery and retry mechanisms
- [ ] **Performance**: < 50ms latency for local network scenario exchange

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] QA review pending.
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] Feedback collection after implementation.
