# Task 1: ONCE Web4ORB Kernel Foundation
[task:uuid:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-1.1-architect-once-kernel-spec.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Task Description
Build ONCE (Object Network Communication Engine) as the foundational Web4ORB kernel that enables P2P distributed object communication across all platforms. ONCE serves as the universal kernel for Web4 ecosystem deployment (browser, Node.js, web workers, service workers, PWA, iframe) with single-line import integration.

## Context
The Web4 Awakening session revealed that TSRanger v3.0 requires a foundational P2P kernel for distributed object communication. ONCE kernel provides the infrastructure for component lifecycle management, scenario exchange, and multi-platform deployment that TSRanger and all Web4 components depend on.

## Intention
Create production-ready ONCE kernel that serves as the universal Web4ORB foundation, enabling component discovery, instantiation, hibernation, and P2P communication across all target platforms with pure Web4 architectural compliance.

## Steps
1. **Architect Phase**: Design ONCE kernel architecture with Web4 patterns (empty constructors, scenario initialization, IOR references)
2. **Core Implementation**: Build ONCE kernel with component lifecycle management APIs
3. **Multi-Platform Engine**: Implement universal deployment across browser/Node.js/workers/PWA
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate ONCE kernel functionality across all target platforms

## Requirements
- [requirement:uuid:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890] ONCE Kernel Core with Web4 compliance
- [requirement:uuid:b2c3d4e5-f6g7-8901-bcde-f23456789012] P2P Scenario Communication between kernels
- Universal deployment with single codebase across 6 platforms
- Component lifecycle management (discovery, instantiation, hibernation, restoration)
- Environment discovery and platform-specific optimization
- Pure Web4 architecture patterns (empty constructors, scenario init, IOR references)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **ONCE Kernel Core**: Empty constructor + scenario initialization pattern implemented
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Single codebase deployed across browser, Node.js, web workers, service workers, PWA, iframe
- [ ] **Component Lifecycle APIs**: `startComponent()`, `saveAsScenario()`, `loadScenario()` methods functional
- [ ] **Environment Discovery**: Automatic platform detection and adaptation system operational
- [ ] **One-Line Import**: `import { ONCE } from 'once-kernel'` works across all platforms
- [ ] **P2P Foundation**: Infrastructure ready for scenario exchange between ONCE kernels
- [ ] **Web4 Compliance**: 100% empty constructors, scenario initialization, IOR references throughout
- [ ] **Performance**: Kernel initialization < 100ms on all platforms
- [ ] **Memory Efficiency**: < 5MB footprint for basic kernel operations
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with scenario-based error recovery

## QA Audit & User Feedback
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] QA review pending after subtask completion.
  - [ ] ONCE kernel architecture validation
  - [ ] Multi-platform deployment testing
  - [ ] Web4 compliance verification
- [ ] [UTC timestamp] User feedback collection for kernel usability and developer experience.
  - [ ] One-line import integration experience
  - [ ] Component lifecycle API usability
  - [ ] Cross-platform consistency validation

## Subtasks
All subtasks ordered to prevent blocking dependencies:
1. **Architecture First**: Kernel specification before implementation
2. **Core Before Deployment**: Core functionality before platform adaptation
3. **Implementation Before Testing**: Working code before test validation

## Dependencies
- **Sprint 20 Outputs**: Web4 architectural principles, IOR reference system, scenario model patterns
- **Web4 Components**: FileUTCRename, Web4Requirement, Web4Test components as reference implementations
- **Target Platforms**: Browser, Node.js, Web Workers, Service Workers, PWA, IFrame runtime environments
