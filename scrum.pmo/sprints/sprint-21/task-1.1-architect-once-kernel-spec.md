# Task 1.1: Architect â€” ONCE Kernel Architecture Specification
[subtask:uuid:11b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef123456789a]

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-1.1-architect-once-kernel-spec.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] QA Review
- [ ] Done

## Task Description
Design comprehensive ONCE kernel architecture specification following pure Web4 principles, defining component lifecycle management, multi-platform deployment patterns, and P2P scenario communication protocols.

## Context
ONCE kernel serves as the foundational Web4ORB infrastructure that enables distributed object communication. The architecture must support universal deployment across 6 platforms while maintaining pure Web4 patterns and providing robust component lifecycle management.

## Intention
Create detailed technical specification that guides ONCE kernel implementation, ensuring Web4 compliance, multi-platform consistency, and P2P communication capability for the entire Web4 ecosystem.

## Steps
1. **Web4 Pattern Specification**: Define empty constructor + scenario initialization pattern for ONCE kernel
2. **Multi-Platform Architecture**: Specify universal deployment strategy across browser/Node.js/workers/PWA
3. **Component Lifecycle Design**: Define APIs for component discovery, instantiation, hibernation, restoration
4. **P2P Communication Protocol**: Specify kernel-to-kernel scenario exchange and com-unique-action patterns
5. **Environment Discovery System**: Design platform detection and adaptation mechanisms
6. **IOR Resolution Architecture**: Define distributed object reference resolution across network boundaries
7. **Error Handling Strategy**: Specify scenario-based error recovery and system resilience
8. **Performance Requirements**: Define resource usage and latency specifications

## Requirements
- Pure Web4 architecture compliance (empty constructors, scenario initialization, IOR references)
- Universal deployment specification for 6 target platforms
- Component lifecycle management API definition
- P2P scenario communication protocol specification
- Environment discovery and platform adaptation design
- Performance and resource usage requirements definition

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Web4 Architecture Spec**: Complete ONCE kernel class definition with empty constructor and scenario initialization
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Specification**: Detailed deployment strategy for browser, Node.js, web workers, service workers, PWA, iframe
- [ ] **Component Lifecycle APIs**: Specification for `startComponent()`, `saveAsScenario()`, `loadScenario()`, `hibernateComponent()` methods
- [ ] **P2P Protocol Definition**: Kernel-to-kernel communication protocol with scenario exchange patterns
- [ ] **Environment Discovery Design**: Platform detection system with adaptation strategies for each target environment
- [ ] **IOR Resolution Architecture**: Network-wide distributed object reference resolution specification
- [ ] **Error Handling Strategy**: Scenario-based error recovery with system resilience patterns
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: < 100ms initialization, < 5MB memory footprint specifications
- [ ] **PlantUML Architecture Diagrams**: Complete visual architecture following GitScrumProject pattern
- [ ] **TypeScript Interface Definitions**: Complete type definitions for all ONCE kernel APIs
