## QA Feedback

**Test completed successfully on 2025-08-11:**

### Results Summary
- Content-aware strategies were correctly applied
- QA feedback files successfully merged using additive strategy (4 instances)
- Sprint task reconciliation attempted but flagged for manual review
- No data loss observed - all content preserved
- Merge reports generated correctly

### Key Findings
1. **QA Feedback Merge**: Working correctly, preserving content with branch context
2. **Sprint Tasks**: Strategy triggers correctly but needs manual review for complex conflicts
3. **Performance**: Script completed in ~1 second for 14 branches
4. **Bug Found**: Script has a syntax error on line 272 (bash array reference issue)

### Recommendations
- Fix the bash syntax error in merge-to-release-dev-v2.sh line 272
- QA feedback has some duplicates that could be cleaned up
- Sprint task reconciliation works but needs enhancement for automatic resolution
