# Project Initialization Process

This document describes the steps taken to initialize the Web4Articles project, including the setup of SCRUM management, documentation, and the project wiki.

## Steps Performed

1. **Created SCRUM Management Structure**
   - Established the `scrum.pmo` directory with subfolders for roles and sprints.
   - Documented naming conventions and folder structure in `process.md`.

2. **Set Up Project Wiki as Submodule**
   - Added the GitHub wiki repository as a submodule in the `wiki` folder.
   - Verified the presence of key documentation files (e.g., `Home.md`, `Ontology.md`).

3. **Created Ontology Page**
   - Added `Ontology.md` to the wiki to define key project terms and concepts.

4. **Documented Role Responsibilities**
   - Created a `process.md` file for each role (DevOps, PO, Developer, ScrumMaster) in their respective folders under `scrum.pmo/roles/`.
   - Outlined the responsibilities and actions taken by each role during initialization.

## Role Assignment Suggestions

- **DevOps:** Responsible for technical setup, submodule management, and automation.
- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines documentation needs, reviews structure, and ensures alignment with project goals.
- **Developer:** Follows conventions, contributes to documentation, and provides feedback.
- **ScrumMaster:** Facilitates the process, ensures documentation, and coordinates between roles.

---
This process ensures a well-structured, documented, and collaborative project foundation.
