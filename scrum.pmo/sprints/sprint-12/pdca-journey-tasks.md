# PDCA 3 - Comprehensive TSRanger Journey Task List

## Plan
- **Objective:** Create detailed task list of TSRanger evolution journey
- **User Directive:** 
  > "write a list of tasks how you got vorm chaos repo to ucp like tsranger"
- **Approach:** Chronological task breakdown from chaos to UCP understanding

## Do
### Complete Journey Task List

#### Phase 1: Initial Chaos (Pre-Sprint 2)
1. **Chaos State**
   - Single `src/` folder with everything mixed
   - Single `test/` folder for all tests  
   - No version management concept
   - No component separation

#### Phase 2: TSRanger Birth (Sprint 2)
2. **Quick Running Code**
   - Created `src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts`
   - Simple run command: `node --loader ts-node/esm src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts`
   - Interactive terminal UI working fast
   - Initial satisfaction with progress

3. **Early Testing Attempts**
   - Write tests using `spawnSync`
   - Tests spawn TSRanger as subprocess
   - **Problem**: TSRanger waits for input, tests hang!
   - Frustration begins

#### Phase 3: Test Mode Solution (Sprint 2 continued)
4. **Creating Test Mode**
   - Add `TSRANGER_TEST_MODE=1` environment variable
   - Add `TSRANGER_TEST_INPUT` for scripted keys
   - Add `TS_RANGER_TEST_FINAL_ONLY=1` for deterministic output
   - Tests finally work but are complex

5. **Test Success Leads to More Tests**
   - `tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts` - 150 lines
   - Multiple test files created
   - Confidence grows with test coverage

#### Phase 4: Refactoring Spiral (Sprint 3-6)
6. **Getting Lost in Refactoring**
   - Task 1.7: Separate Model/View/Controller
   - More layers added (layer2, layer4, layer5)
   - Code gets more complex
   - Original simplicity lost

7. **The Breaking Point**
   - Single `src/` can't handle multiple versions
   - Single `test/` folder becoming unwieldy
   - Need v2 but where to put it?
   - **User Quote**: "we only have one src dir"

#### Phase 5: Giving Up and Rethinking (Pre-Sprint 7)
8. **The "Giving Up" Moment**
   - Realize current structure unsustainable
   - Need fundamental restructuring
   - But how? No clear path forward

#### Phase 6: Component Architecture Discovery (Sprint 7)
9. **v2.5 Vision Emerges**
   - Create `components/TSRanger/` directory
   - Add version folders: `v2.5/`
   - Separate IO for better testing
   - Structure: `components/TSRanger/v2.5/src/ts/`

10. **Implementing Component Structure**
    - Task 2.1: Architect defines module boundaries
    - Git submodule for TSRanger component
    - Multiple versions can coexist
    - Test folders per version

#### Phase 7: The Missing Knowledge
11. **Component Without UCP Understanding**
    - Created component structure
    - But didn't know about UCP standard
    - **User Quote**: "lack of knowledge that UCP existed"
    - Working solution but missing deeper meaning

#### Phase 8: UCP Discovery (Post-Implementation)
12. **Learning What UCP Really Means**
    - Units, Components, Packages definition
    - 4 qualities of true components
    - Historical context from 1968
    - Realization: we accidentally followed UCP!

## Check
### Journey Validation Against User Quotes
- ✅ "vorm chaos repo to ucp" - Full journey mapped
- ✅ "havin running code quickly" - Sprint 2 quick start documented
- ✅ "having tests fast" - Initial test attempts captured
- ✅ "trouble with testing and hanging scripts" - spawnSync issues detailed
- ✅ "making tsranger havin a test mode" - Test mode evolution shown
- ✅ "loosing yourself in refactoring" - Refactoring spiral documented
- ✅ "giving up and think about a new v2" - Breaking point identified
- ✅ "we only have one src dir" - Structure limitation highlighted
- ✅ "lack of knowledge that UCP existed" - Missing knowledge noted

## Act
- Use this task list to structure article sections
- Add specific code examples for each phase
