# Task 12.2.1: ScrumMaster - Fix Sprint 0-3 Structures

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [x] In Progress
- [x] QA Review
- [x] Done

## Task Description
Fix structural issues in Sprints 0-3, focusing on critical foundation issues.

## Context
These early sprints established patterns that need correction:
- Sprint 0: Mixed patterns, missing roles
- Sprint 1: Duplicate task file
- Sprint 2: Unclear task-1.md purpose
- Sprint 3: Very high task numbers (up to 1.15)

## Intention
Ensure foundation sprints follow correct patterns for all future sprints to reference.

## Steps

### Sprint 0 Fixes
1. Task 5 has refinements (5.1-5.6) - these are correctly structured
2. Task 7 has refinements (7.1-7.4) - these are correctly structured
3. Task 8 has refinement 8.1 - correctly structured
4. No fixes needed - Sprint 0 is actually well structured!

### Sprint 1 Fixes
1. Remove duplicate `task-1-tssh-wrapper.md` (keep task-1.0)
2. Fix numbering: task-1.1.5 should be task-1.5.1
3. Ensure all refinements have proper roles

### Sprint 2 Fixes
1. Check if task-1.md is a major task or should be removed
2. Verify refinement structure

### Sprint 3 Fixes
1. Review if tasks 1.10-1.15 should be separate major tasks
2. Consider restructuring if needed

## Requirements
- Use git mv to preserve history
- Update planning files
- Document all changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Sprint 0 verified/fixed (already well structured!)
- [x] Sprint 1 duplicate resolved (removed task-1-tssh-wrapper.md)
- [x] Sprint 2 structure clarified (renamed task-1.md to task-1.0)
- [x] Sprint 3 numbering reviewed (OK - all are refinements)
- [x] Sprint 9 planning.md created

## Additional Actions Taken
- Fixed Sprint 1 numbering: task-1.1.5 â†’ task-1.5.1
- Created missing Sprint 9 planning.md
