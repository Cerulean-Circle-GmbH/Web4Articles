# Task 12.2.2: ScrumMaster - Fix Sprint 5-8 Structures

## Status
- [x] Planned
- [x] In Progress
- [x] QA Review

## Task Description
Standardize Sprint 5-8 structures for consistency across the project.

## Context
These sprints have moderate issues affecting consistency:
- Sprint 5: Mixed naming (T5.* and task-5.*)
- Sprint 6: Missing planning.md
- Sprint 7: Missing planning.md
- Sprint 8: Some missing descriptions in task names

## Intention
Ensure all sprints follow consistent patterns for easier navigation and understanding.

## Steps

### Sprint 5 Fixes
1. Standardize T5.* files to task-5.* format
2. Verify all tasks have proper descriptions

### Sprint 6 Fixes
1. Create planning.md based on existing tasks
2. Document sprint goal and context

### Sprint 7 Fixes
1. Create planning.md based on existing tasks
2. Document sprint goal and context

### Sprint 8 Fixes
1. Add descriptions to task names where missing
2. Verify consistency

## Requirements
- Use git mv to preserve history
- Create planning files with proper context
- Document all changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Sprint 5 naming standardized (already good!)
- [x] Sprint 6 planning.md created (already exists!)
- [x] Sprint 7 planning.md created (already exists!)
- [x] Sprint 8 task names complete (research sprint, no tasks)

## Additional Actions Taken
- Sprint 10: Renamed plan.md â†’ planning.md
- All Phase 2 sprints now have consistent structure
