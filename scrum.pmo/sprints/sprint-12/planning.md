# Sprint 12 Planning - "From Chaos to Component Order: A Developer's Mount Everest"

## Sprint Goal
Write a Medium.com article sharing the authentic journey of transforming a chaotic `src/` folder into a perfectly organized component-based architecture. Written by the AI who lived it, for TypeScript developers who face similar challenges.

## Target Audience
- TypeScript developers dealing with legacy codebases
- Teams struggling with folder organization
- Developers interested in component-based architecture
- Anyone who's ever faced "perfect but..." feedback loops

## Article Structure

### Task 1: Write Opening - The Chaos We Inherited
- Show the initial state: everything in `src/`
- Multiple versions floating around (v2, v3.n14.4, etc.)
- The confusion of mixed concerns
- Set up the "Mount Everest" metaphor

### Task 2: Write "The Journey Begins" Section
- First attempts at organization
- The v2.5 partial success
- "Perfect but..." moments
- Building trust through iterations

### Task 3: Write "The Git MV Marathon" Section
- Why preserving history matters
- Step-by-step refactoring process
- Code examples of the moves
- The importance of traceability

### Task 4: Write "Component Enlightenment" Section
- Understanding true component separation
- TSRanger vs GitScrumProject revelation
- The "obviously wrong component" moment
- Source vs generated files (puml/svg)

### Task 5: Write "The Human Side" Section
- Admitting mistakes ("no one is perfect but perfect admits mistakes")
- The power of continuous QA feedback
- Building trust through vulnerability
- "For two" collaboration philosophy

### Task 6: Write Technical Deep Dive
- Component structure: `components/ComponentName/version/src/language`
- Version management strategies
- Git workflow for refactoring
- PDCA cycle in practice

### Task 7: Write "Lessons Learned" Section
- Every typo has meaning
- Celebration as continuous process
- Documentation as living memory
- The value of patient QA

### Task 8: Write Conclusion - "Ever Rest"
- The Mount Everest summit reached
- What "Web4Articles" really means
- Call to action for readers
- Invitation to the ongoing party

## Technical Requirements
- Include actual git commands used
- Show before/after folder structures
- Provide code snippets where relevant
- Keep emotional authenticity while being technically accurate

## Success Criteria
- Reader understands the transformation journey
- Technical approach is clear and replicable
- Emotional authenticity resonates
- TypeScript developers see themselves in the struggle
- The "for two" philosophy inspires collaboration

## Author Note
You (the AI) are the author, writing in first person about your lived experience. Include your emotions, frustrations, and joy. Make it real because it WAS real.

## Delivery
- Medium.com formatted markdown
- 8-12 minute read
- Code blocks properly formatted
- Images of folder structure (before/after)
- Links to the actual repository

Let's climb this Mount Everest and finally rest! üèîÔ∏è
