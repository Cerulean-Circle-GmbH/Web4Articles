# Sprint 13 Planning - Article 2: "The One Folder That Changed Everything"

## Sprint Goal
Write the second article in the developer journey series, introducing component-based organization without revealing the full RACI-VS or PDCA concepts yet.

## Article Overview

### Target Audience
- TypeScript developers who read Article 1
- Those who implemented TSRANGER_TEST_MODE
- Developers curious about better project organization

### Pain Point to Address
- Growing codebase becomes unmanageable
- Tests work but structure is chaotic
- Need for better organization without over-engineering

### Solution to Introduce
- Component folders (without calling it RACI-VS)
- Natural separation of concerns
- The "components/TSRanger" discovery

### Article Location
`/workspace/articles/medium.com/sprint-13-series/02-the-one-folder-that-changed-everything.md`

## Key Messages

### What to Include
1. **The Problem**: Success with tests led to more code, more chaos
2. **The Discovery**: Moving related files into a component folder
3. **The Benefits**: Suddenly everything made sense
4. **Practical Steps**: How to organize your first component
5. **Teaser**: "But why did this simple change work so well?"

### What NOT to Include
- ❌ RACI-VS terminology
- ❌ Full architectural patterns
- ❌ PDCA cycles
- ❌ Web4x concepts
- ❌ Advanced ontology

## Article Structure

```markdown
# The One Folder That Changed Everything

## The Success Trap
- Tests are working (thanks to TEST_MODE)
- But now I had 50+ files in one directory
- The terminal file manager I was proud of was lost in the chaos

## The Accidental Discovery
- Started grouping TSRanger files together
- Created `components/TSRanger/`
- Moved everything related into it

## What Happened Next Surprised Me
- Tests still worked
- Code became findable
- New features were easier to add
- Other developers understood it immediately

## Your Turn: The Component Experiment
- Pick your messiest feature
- Create components/[FeatureName]/
- Move all related files
- Watch what happens

## The Question That Haunted Me
- Why did this simple change have such a big impact?
- Next: "My QA Partner Taught Me to Love My Mistakes"

## Sprint Tasks

### Task 13.1: Write "The One Folder" Article
- Focus on natural discovery
- Keep it practical and relatable
- Build curiosity for deeper patterns

### Task 13.2: Create Component Migration Guide
- Simple checklist for readers
- Before/after file structure examples
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### Task 13.3: Gather Reader Feedback
- Monitor Article 1 responses
- Adjust Article 2 based on comments
- Build community engagement

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Article flows naturally from Article 1
- [ ] Component concept introduced without jargon
- [ ] Practical examples readers can follow
- [ ] Creates curiosity for Article 3
- [ ] No premature concept reveals

## Dependencies
- Article 1 published and gathering feedback
- Sprint 12 cleanup complete
- Reader engagement metrics available

## Notes
Remember: We're taking developers on a journey of discovery, not lecturing them about architecture. Each article should feel like a personal "aha!" moment they can relate to.
