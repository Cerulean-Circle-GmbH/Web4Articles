# Sprint 13 Planning

## Goal
Transform our Medium article into a masterpiece using Dan Roam's visual drama structure and the Hero's Journey pattern, emphasizing the "for two" collaboration, the Pareto 80/20 breakthrough moment, and our complementary strengths (including typo acknowledgment).

## Background
After planning Sprint 12's article, we realize it needs the power of proven storytelling frameworks:
- **Dan Roam's 4-Act Drama**: A visual thinking approach to storytelling (Setting → Character → Challenge → Resolution)
- **Hero's Journey**: Joseph Campbell's monomyth pattern that resonates universally
- **Pareto Principle**: We reached 80% completion at the "you did perfect but..." moment
- **"For Two" Dynamic**: Two complementary experts acknowledging each other's strengths and weaknesses

The user beautifully acknowledged: "one of my biggest weaknesses is typos" - showing the vulnerability that makes great collaboration.

## Sprint Themes
1. **Visual Drama Structure**: Apply Dan Roam's 4-act framework
2. **Hero's Journey Integration**: Map our story to the universal pattern
3. **Pareto 80/20 Insight**: The pivotal moment when party planning revealed we were 80% done
4. **Complementary Partnership**: "For two" - how different strengths created success
5. **Vulnerability as Strength**: Typos and other weaknesses made us stronger together

## Tasks

### Task 1: Research and Document Storytelling Frameworks
- [ ] Research Dan Roam's visual drama structure in detail
- [ ] Study Hero's Journey pattern for technical stories
- [ ] Create framework mapping for our article
- [ ] Document how both patterns complement each other

### Task 2: Dan Roam's 4-Act Drama Structure
- [ ] **Act 1 - Setting**: The chaotic codebase landscape
- [ ] **Act 2 - Character**: Two complementary experts meet
- [ ] **Act 3 - Challenge**: Mount Everest of transformation
- [ ] **Act 4 - Resolution**: Component order achieved "for two"

### Task 3: Hero's Journey Mapping
- [ ] **Ordinary World**: Chaos src folders everywhere
- [ ] **Call to Adventure**: "recover from readme as role ontology agent"
- [ ] **Mentor**: QA feedback and collaborative spirit
- [ ] **Crossing Threshold**: Understanding components
- [ ] **Tests & Allies**: Sprint confusion, v3.0 obsolescence
- [ ] **Ordeal**: "You did perfect but..." admission
- [ ] **Reward**: Clean component structure
- [ ] **Return**: Writing the article to guide others

### Task 4: The Pareto 80/20 Moment
- [ ] Document the exact moment: "let's have a party" → "small backdraw"
- [ ] Show how we were 80% done when we thought we were finished
- [ ] Highlight the final 20% that made perfection
- [ ] Connect to universal developer experience

### Task 5: "For Two" Complementary Dynamics
- [ ] Developer strengths: Technical vision, architecture
- [ ] QA strengths: Diligence, attention to detail
- [ ] Developer weakness: Typos (acknowledged vulnerability)
- [ ] QA role: Catching what developer misses
- [ ] Show how "we need each other" manifested

### Task 6: Visual Elements Enhancement
- [ ] Dan Roam-style napkin sketches
- [ ] Hero's Journey diagram with our milestones
- [ ] Pareto chart showing the 80/20 moment
- [ ] "For two" collaboration visualization

### Task 7: Vulnerability and Strength Integration
- [ ] Typo examples as humanizing elements
- [ ] Mistakes as learning opportunities
- [ ] Humble admissions as trust builders
- [ ] Show how weaknesses led to better solutions

### Task 8: Rewrite with Enhanced Structure
- [ ] Apply all frameworks to existing content
- [ ] Ensure emotional peaks align with story acts
- [ ] Place Pareto moment as climactic turning point
- [ ] End with "for two" celebration and future

## Success Criteria
- Article follows both Dan Roam and Hero's Journey structures
- Pareto 80/20 moment is clearly pivotal
- "For two" collaboration shines throughout
- Vulnerability (typos) enhances rather than detracts
- Readers feel inspired to find their complementary partner
- Story structure makes technical content universally relatable

## Technical Specifications
- Visual diagrams in Dan Roam's style
- Clear act/stage markers throughout
- Sidebar boxes for framework explanations
- Pull quotes for key vulnerable moments
- 15-20 minute read time (enhanced from Sprint 12)

## Dependencies
- Sprint 12 base article content
- Understanding of storytelling frameworks
- Visual creation tools
- Vulnerability to share weaknesses

## Risks
- Risk: Over-structuring loses authenticity
  - Mitigation: Let emotion guide structure
- Risk: Too many frameworks confuse
  - Mitigation: Seamlessly blend them

## Notes
The "rockstar" compliment shows we're hitting the right emotional notes. By adding these storytelling frameworks and emphasizing the "for two" dynamic (including typo acknowledgment), we transform a good article into an unforgettable journey that developers will share and remember.

## Stakeholders
- **Author**: ScrumMaster (with typos!)
- **Co-Author**: QA (catches the typos!)
- **Framework Guide**: Dan Roam & Joseph Campbell
- **Target Audience**: Developers seeking their complementary partner
