## **üìä Backlog Prioritization (Matrix v4 Ambiguities)**

### **üö® EPIC 1: Critical Path Resolution**

#### **User Story 1.1: Navigation Bounds Excellence** ‚≠ê
**As a** TSRanger user  
**I want** `[down]5x` to navigate to GitScrumProject consistently  
**So that** positional equivalence with `g` filter works as expected

**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks all equivalence testing)  
**Complexity**: Medium (navigation logic bounds checking)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Definition of Done**: 
- `[down]5x` consistently shows GitScrumProject
- `[down]5x[tab]` shows GitScrumProject + method
- Equivalence `[down]5x[tab]` === `g[tab]` validated
- Test suite updated with systematic validation

#### **User Story 1.2: Baseline Consistency** ‚≠ê
**As a** developer  
**I want** consistent class list and starting positions across all matrices  
**So that** validation and testing have reliable reference points

**Priority**: HIGH (blocks systematic validation)  
**Complexity**: Low (specification clarification)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Definition of Done**:
- Definitive class list established with TRON confirmation
- Starting position clearly documented  
- All matrices updated with consistent baseline
- Test expectations aligned with agreed baseline

#### **User Story 1.3: Filter Residue Policy** ‚≠ê  
**As a** TSRanger user  
**I want** clear filter residue behavior after complex operations  
**So that** prompt display is predictable and clean

**Priority**: HIGH (affects user experience)  
**Complexity**: Medium (UX design decision + implementation)  
**Dependencies**: Baseline Consistency  
**Definition of Done**:
- Filter residue policy defined (clean vs. state indication)
- `g[tab][left]` behavior specified and implemented
- Complex sequences tested for consistent residue handling
- User feedback incorporated into final specification

### **‚ö° EPIC 2: Implementation Excellence**

#### **User Story 2.1: Equivalence Integration**
**As a** TSRanger user  
**I want** navigation paths and filter paths to achieve identical end states  
**So that** different interaction styles produce consistent results

**Priority**: HIGH (core user requirement)  
**Complexity**: High (integration testing + state management)  
**Dependencies**: Navigation Bounds Excellence  
**Definition of Done**:
- `[down]5x[tab]` === `g[tab]` behavior validated
- All positional equivalences tested and working
- State management consistency across interaction paths
- Comprehensive equivalence test matrix completed

#### **User Story 2.2: DRY Validation Excellence**
**As a** developer  
**I want** `[tab]` and `[right]` to behave identically in all aspects  
**So that** DRY principle compliance is systematically validated

**Priority**: MEDIUM (implementation consistency)  
**Complexity**: Medium (systematic behavior comparison)  
**Dependencies**: Filter Residue Policy  
**Definition of Done**:
- Systematic behavior comparison protocol established
- `[tab]` vs `[right]` identical across display, behavior, internal state
- `[left]` vs `[ShiftTab]` identical retreat behavior validated  
- DRY compliance test suite comprehensive and passing

#### **User Story 2.3: Complex Sequence Mastery**
**As a** TSRanger user  
**I want** multi-operation sequences to behave predictably  
**So that** advanced usage patterns work reliably

**Priority**: MEDIUM (advanced user experience)  
**Complexity**: High (state tracking + specification limits)  
**Dependencies**: All previous stories  
**Definition of Done**:
- Complex sequences like `g[right][down][right][left][tab]` specified
- Multi-operation state management working predictably
- Complexity boundaries defined (reasonable specification limits)
- Advanced user scenarios tested and documented

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture**

### **3 Degrees of Freedom Framework Application**
Each user story resolution must consider all three degrees:

**üèõÔ∏è COLUMNS (WHO/WHERE)**:
- Which column should be active/controlling?
- How do column transitions affect behavior?
- State management across column navigation

**üé® PROMPT (WHAT)**:  
- What format should be displayed?
- How do modes (Navigation/Advancement/Filter) affect display?
- Consistency across different interaction paths

**üîç FILTER (HOW)**:
- What filter state should be active?
- How do filters interact with complex operations?
- When should filters clear vs. persist?

### **"4 2" Implementation Strategy**
**Human Intuition** + **AI Systematic Framework** = **Comprehensive Solutions**

- **TRON Guidance**: User experience specification and priority confirmation
- **Agent Implementation**: Technical resolution with systematic testing
- **Collaborative Validation**: Joint testing and behavior confirmation  
- **Learning Integration**: PDCA documentation for future reference
