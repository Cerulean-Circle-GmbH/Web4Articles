## **Do**

### **üé≠ Role Switch Recognition:**

#### **Implicit Transition Moment:**
During Sprint 19 creation, the focus shifted from pure technical implementation (Developer role) to user value specification, story creation, and systematic planning (Product Owner role). This wasn't explicitly declared but emerged naturally from the need to transform Matrix v4 ambiguities into actionable user requirements.

#### **PO Mindset Application:**

**User Value Focus:**
- Transformed technical "bugs" into user experience requirements
- Created user stories with "As a...I want...So that..." format
- Prioritized based on user impact rather than technical complexity
- Defined success criteria from user satisfaction perspective

**Systematic Planning Excellence:**
- 6 ambiguities ‚Üí 6 user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Epic organization (Critical Path, Implementation Excellence)
- Risk management from product delivery perspective
- Sprint timeline based on user value delivery

**Stakeholder Collaboration:**
- TRON guidance requests structured as PO-stakeholder engagement
- Decision matrix creation for user specification clarification
- Requirements traceability for user feedback integration
- Quality assurance from user experience perspective
