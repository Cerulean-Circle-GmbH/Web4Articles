# Task E2: IOR Reference Implementation
[task:uuid:e2a3b4c5-d6e7-8901-bcde-f2345678901a]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<epic><number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<epic><number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-e2.1-developer-ior-interface-unit.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Task Description
Implement units ready to reference IOR.interface.ts as origin with automatic synchronization when the origin is updated. This complements Task E1 and completes the primary Sprint-22 deliverable for interface origin auto-synchronization.

## Context
IOR (Interoperable Object Reference) is fundamental to Web4 distributed object identification. Units must reference IOR.interface.ts and automatically sync when the interface evolves. This enables:
- Unit creation with IOR.interface.ts as IOR origin
- Automatic detection of IOR interface changes
- Copy synchronization maintaining IOR consistency across Web4 ecosystem
- Version management for IOR interface evolution

## Intention
IOR reference implementation establishes the pattern for distributed object reference consistency across the Web4 network. This task ensures that all units referencing IOR interface remain synchronized with the authoritative definition.

### **Why This Task Exists:**
1. **Distributed Consistency:** IOR interface changes must propagate across entire Web4 network
2. **Object Reference Integrity:** All IOR-based references must remain consistent
3. **Cross-Network Compatibility:** IOR interface evolution must not break distributed communication
4. **Universal Reference Standard:** IOR interface serves as foundation for all object references

### **Problems This Task Solves:**
- **IOR Drift Problem:** IOR interface changes not propagated to distributed references
- **Cross-Network Inconsistency:** Different Web4 nodes using different IOR interface versions
- **Reference Integrity Problem:** IOR-based object references become invalid after interface changes
- **Version Compatibility Problem:** IOR interface evolution breaks existing object references

### **How This Task Solves These Problems:**
- **IOR Origin Reference:** IOR.interface.ts becomes authoritative origin for all IOR units
- **Distributed Change Detection:** Monitor IOR interface across Web4 network nodes
- **Network-Wide Synchronization:** Update all IOR references when interface changes
- **Compatibility Preservation:** Maintain backward compatibility during IOR evolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit can be created with IOR.interface.ts as IOR origin reference
- [ ] Origin change detection monitors IOR.interface.ts modifications across network
- [ ] Automatic synchronization updates IOR references when interface changes
- [ ] Cross-network IOR consistency maintained during interface evolution
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved for existing IOR-based object references
- [ ] Complete traceability from IOR.interface.ts to all distributed references
- [ ] Integration with Web4 network communication infrastructure
- [ ] Performance optimized for distributed change detection and synchronization

## Dependencies
- **Requires:** Task D1-D3 (Universal IOR Origin Format) - IOR-based origin foundation
- **Requires:** Task E3 (Origin Change Detection) - Change monitoring for IOR interface
- **Requires:** Task E4 (Copy Synchronization Framework) - Network-wide synchronization
- **Requires:** Task E1 (Scenario Reference) - Parallel implementation pattern
- **Integrates:** Sprint-20 IOR foundation work - Existing IOR interface structure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] IOR.interface.ts successfully referenced as unit origin
- [ ] Automatic synchronization functional across Web4 network
- [ ] Cross-network traceability from IOR origin to all references
- [ ] Distributed performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Network compatibility maintained during IOR evolution
- [ ] Integration tests pass with existing Web4 network infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation complete with distributed usage examples
