# Task A1: Unit Deduplication Framework Implementation
[task:uuid:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-a1234567890b]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<epic><number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<epic><number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-a1.1-developer-uuid-unique-identification.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress
  - [ ] refinement
  - [ ] creating test cases

## Task Description
Implement the core deduplication framework that units solve: exactly one UUID for each named entity with single authoritative definition. This addresses the fundamental problem of duplicate definitions across the Web4 codebase.

## Context
TRON identified that "units mainly solve the deduplication issue. they give exactly one uuid for a named thing and one definition." Current Web4Articles has multiple definitions of same concepts across different files, components, and versions. This creates:
- Inconsistent definitions for same concepts
- Confusion about authoritative sources
- Maintenance overhead for synchronized updates
- Quality degradation from definition drift

## Intention
Unit deduplication framework establishes single source of truth for all named entities in Web4 ecosystem. This fundamental capability enables all other unit features (traceability, auto-sync, model repository) by providing unique identification and authoritative definition management.

### **Why This Task Exists:**
1. **Single Source of Truth:** Core Web4 architectural principle requiring unique definitions
2. **Definition Authority:** Need authoritative source for all named entities
3. **Maintenance Efficiency:** Eliminate duplicate definition maintenance overhead
4. **Quality Assurance:** Prevent definition drift and inconsistency

### **Problems This Task Solves:**
- **Duplication Problem:** Multiple definitions of same concept across codebase
- **Authority Problem:** Unclear which definition is authoritative
- **Consistency Problem:** Definitions drift apart over time without synchronization
- **Maintenance Problem:** Updates must be applied to multiple locations manually

### **How This Task Solves These Problems:**
- **UUID Unique Identification:** Each named entity gets exactly one UUID globally
- **Single Definition Storage:** One authoritative definition per UUID
- **Source Reference System:** Definition references authoritative source
- **Update Propagation:** Changes to authoritative source propagate to all references

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UUID unique identification system prevents duplicate UUIDs for same entity
- [ ] Single definition enforcement ensures exactly one authoritative definition per UUID
- [ ] Definition source reference system links definitions to authoritative sources
- [ ] Duplicate detection system identifies existing definitions before creating new ones
- [ ] Definition validation ensures consistency and completeness
- [ ] Update propagation mechanism notifies all references when definition changes
- [ ] Integration with existing Unit CLI and storage infrastructure
- [ ] Performance optimized for large-scale deduplication across Web4 ecosystem

## Dependencies
- **Requires:** Sprint-20 Task 11 (Unit Simplification) - Clean unit foundation
- **Requires:** Sprint-20 Task 15 (Model Separation) - Proper model architecture
- **Requires:** Sprint-20 Task 18 (Terminal Identity) - Name, origin, definition fields
- **Enables:** Task A2-A3 (Definition Source & Usage Traceability) - Builds on deduplication
- **Enables:** All other Sprint-22 tasks - Deduplication foundation for advanced features

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Exactly one UUID per named entity enforced across Web4 ecosystem
- [ ] Single authoritative definition per UUID established and maintained
- [ ] Definition source reference system functional and tested
- [ ] Duplicate detection prevents creation of redundant definitions
- [ ] Update propagation mechanism operational
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements for ecosystem-scale operation
- [ ] Integration tests pass with existing Unit and component infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation complete with deduplication usage patterns
