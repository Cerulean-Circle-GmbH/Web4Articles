# Task E1: Scenario.interface.ts Reference Implementation
[task:uuid:e1a2b3c4-d5e6-7890-abcd-e1f234567890]

## Naming Conventions
- Tasks: `task-<epic><number>-<short-description>.md`
- Subtasks: `task-<epic><number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-e1.1-developer-scenario-interface-unit.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.

## Status
- [ ] Planned
- [ ] In Progress

## Task Description
Implement units ready to reference scenario.interface.ts as origin with automatic synchronization when the origin is updated. This is the primary Sprint-22 deliverable enabling units to maintain consistency with their TypeScript interface origins.

## Context
Units need to reference scenario.interface.ts and automatically sync when origins change. This solves the fundamental problem that ln links have no backlink traceability while units do. The implementation must enable:
- Unit creation with scenario.interface.ts as IOR origin
- Automatic detection of origin file changes
- Copy synchronization for same UUID units across locations
- Version differentiation for different UUID units

## Intention
Scenario.interface.ts reference implementation demonstrates the complete unit auto-sync pattern that will be applied to all Web4 interface origins. This establishes units as the foundational node of the model repository with complete traceability.

### **Why This Task Exists:**
1. **Auto-Sync Foundation:** Demonstrates complete origin-to-copy synchronization pattern
2. **Scenario Traceability:** Enables complete tracking from interface definition to all usage
3. **Unit Advantage:** Shows backlink traceability advantage over ln links
4. **Model Repository:** Establishes unit as foundational node pattern

### **Problems This Task Solves:**
- **Origin Drift Problem:** Scenario interface changes not propagated to referencing units
- **Consistency Problem:** No automatic synchronization between origin and copies
- **Traceability Problem:** Cannot track all references to scenario interface
- **Version Problem:** Cannot distinguish between versions vs copies of same interface

### **How This Task Solves These Problems:**
- **Origin IOR Reference:** scenario.interface.ts becomes IOR origin for unit
- **Change Detection:** Monitor scenario interface file for modifications
- **Automatic Synchronization:** Update all referencing units when origin changes
- **UUID-Based Identity:** Same UUID = copy sync, Different UUID = version independence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit can be created with scenario.interface.ts as IOR origin reference
- [ ] Origin change detection system monitors scenario.interface.ts modifications
- [ ] Automatic synchronization updates unit copies when scenario interface changes
- [ ] Same UUID units across different locations maintain consistency
- [ ] Different UUID units handle versioning independently
- [ ] Complete backlink traceability from scenario.interface.ts to all referencing units
- [ ] Integration with existing Unit CLI and model infrastructure
- [ ] Performance optimized for efficient change detection and synchronization

## Dependencies
- **Requires:** Task D1-D3 (Universal IOR Origin Format) - Foundation for IOR-based origins
- **Requires:** Task E3 (Origin Change Detection) - Change monitoring infrastructure
- **Requires:** Task E4 (Copy Synchronization Framework) - Synchronization mechanism
- **Integrates:** Sprint-20 Task 18 (Terminal Identity) - Origin reference metadata
- **Integrates:** Sprint-20 Task 27 (Model Interface) - Type foundation for scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] scenario.interface.ts successfully referenced as unit origin
- [ ] Automatic synchronization functional and tested
- [ ] Complete traceability from origin to all references
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation complete with usage examples
- [ ] Integration tests pass with existing Unit infrastructure
