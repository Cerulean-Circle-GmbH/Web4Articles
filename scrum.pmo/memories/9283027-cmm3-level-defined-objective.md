## Memory Content

**CMM3 (Minimum Acceptable):** Scientific reproducibility independent of context or personal interpretation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Assembly line precision with no undefined states
- No variations allowed - identical results every time
- Unit exists that defines it completely, objectively
- System halts when undefined (economically critical)
- Foundation: Small automated well-tested first principles
- OOP encapsulated building blocks

**Example:** Automated bread machine with precise parameters - same result regardless of operator.

**Requirement:** All processes must achieve CMM3 reproducibility before CMM4 improvement cycles.

## Web4 Application
- Template Version 3.1.4.2 compliance without variation
- Dual link format exactly as specified (no interpretation)
- Component patterns followed precisely
- Process steps executed identically regardless of agent

## Violation Detection
- Individual variations in template following
- Subjective interpretations of requirements
- "Close enough" approaches to specifications
- Manual processes that could be automated
