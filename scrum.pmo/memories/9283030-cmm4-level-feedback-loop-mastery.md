## Memory Content

**CMM4 (Target Level):** Feedback loop mastery - run CMM3 systems multiple times to understand them as whiteboxes.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Pinpoint exact improvement opportunities without breaking existing success
- PDCA is a CMM4 feedback loop system
- Systematic improvement through comprehensive understanding
- Run systems multiple times for whitebox analysis
- 80/20 efficiency targeting (like SpaceX, not NASA perfection)

**PDCA Connection:**
- **Plan:** Design improvement based on whitebox system understanding
- **Do:** Execute planned change systematically  
- **Check:** Measure if plan worked AND if execution was correct
- **Act:** Address everything that didn't achieve improvement or worsened situation

**Critical Pattern:** Repeat Check-Act cycles until CMM4 improvement achieved, not single-pass execution.

## Web4 Application
- Run SessionSummary tool multiple times to understand automation patterns
- Analyze component patterns across versions for improvement opportunities
- Use PDCA cycles iteratively until systematic improvement achieved
- Apply feedback loops to all tool development and process enhancement

## Tool Integration
- Use write_todo for tracking Check-Act iterations systematically
- Never try to manage complex improvement cycles manually
- Apply systematic measurement in Check sections
- Continue iterations until goal achieved or user stops
