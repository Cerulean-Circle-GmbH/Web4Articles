# PDCA — Ontology Architect — 2025-08-10

## Plan
- Objective: Improve ontology coverage and establish continuous improvement loop.
- Targets:
  - Nouns: +34 (from 10 to 44)
  - Verbs: +14 (from 10 to 24)
  - Ambiguities: +10 (from 5 to 15)
- Scope: Scan project markdown to extract key terms; update indexes; record PDCA.
- Acceptance: Index files updated; counts reflected in `ontology.status.md`; changes logged in `recovery.md`; index lists PDCA record.

## Do
- Expanded `wiki/ontology/nouns.index.md`, `verbs.index.md`, `ambiguities.index.md` with terms discovered via repository scan.
- Updated `wiki/ontology/ontology.status.md` with timestamp and new counts.
- Created this PDCA entry.

## Check
- Files exist and render: nouns/verbs/ambiguities/status present under `wiki/ontology/`.
- Counts in `ontology.status.md` match list lengths (N:44, V:24, A:15).
- `index.md` includes ontology files and PDCA record.
- No broken links introduced (no new links added in this cycle).

## Act
- Next cycle actions:
  - Add cross-links from each term to source occurrences and definitions.
  - Introduce a pre-commit link validator for ontology files.
  - Define a term definition template and start normalizing entries.
  - Consider modularizing status into per-index summaries.
