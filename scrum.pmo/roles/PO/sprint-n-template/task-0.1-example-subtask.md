# Task 0.1: Example Subtask

## Naming Conventions
- Subtasks: `task-<number>.<subnumber>-<role>-<short-description>.md` (e.g., `task-1.1-developer-setup.md`)
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename.
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.
