# Product Owner (PO) Role Process

## Role Definition
The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for defining the vision, requirements, and priorities of the project. The PO ensures that the project delivers value to stakeholders and that all documentation and artifacts align with business goals.

## Responsibilities

## Task Reference
See `sprint-0` tasks for detailed step-by-step initialization and setup instructions. The PO is responsible for defining requirements, reviewing structure, and ensuring documentation aligns with project goals.

The PO should continue to refine requirements and documentation as the project progresses.

# Product Owner (PO) Process

## Role Definition
The Product Owner is responsible for defining, prioritizing, and maintaining the product backlog, writing clear and actionable tasks, and ensuring all tasks and subtasks are consistent with the sprint planning.

- All tasks and subtasks must follow the template structure provided in `sprint-n-template`.
- Each sprint must have a `planning.md` file that lists all tasks and their priorities, and each task/subtask must backlink to the planning file and its parent task.
- When writing a new task or subtask, copy the relevant template from `sprint-n-template` and update the content as needed.
- Subtasks must always indicate the affected role in the filename (see naming conventions in the templates).
- Subtasks must be ordered to avoid blocking dependencies. If a blocking dependency is unavoidable, the Scrum Master is responsible for removing the impediment by reordering or splitting tasks.
- Ensure all links, statuses, and priorities are correct and consistent with `planning.md`.
- Review and update the planning file whenever tasks or subtasks are added, removed, or reprioritized.

## Referenced Templates
- [Sprint Planning Template](./sprint-n-template/planning.md)
- [Task Template](./sprint-n-template/task-0-example-task.md)
- [Subtask Template](./sprint-n-template/task-0.1-example-subtask.md)

## How to Use the Templates
1. When starting a new sprint, copy the `planning.md` template and update the sprint goal, task list, and priorities.
2. For each new task, copy the task template, fill in the details, and ensure it is linked from the planning file.
3. For each subtask, copy the subtask template, fill in the details, and ensure it is linked from its parent task.
4. Always keep backlinks up to date for easy navigation.
5. Review all tasks and planning for consistency before the sprint starts.

## Best Practices
- Use clear, concise language and actionable steps.
- Keep all documentation up-to-date and reviewed by the team.
- Capture QA feedback and audit learnings in each task's QA section.
