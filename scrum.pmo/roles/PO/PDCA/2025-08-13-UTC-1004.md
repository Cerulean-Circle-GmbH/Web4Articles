# PDCA (Cycle) — Adopting Shared PDCA + Linking Policy

## Plan
- **Objective:** Adopt shared PDCA process and GitHub-first dual-linking across role process docs
- **Scope:** Role `process.md` updates for PDCA and linking policy; seed PDCA
- **Targets (metrics):** 7 role processes updated; 7 PDCA files created
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md
  - scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Role processes include PDCA + linking policy sections
  - PDCA entries created in each role’s PDCA dir
- **Assumptions:** Index references are authoritative
- **Constraints:** Keep existing content; add minimal sections only
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Update selectively (less churn) vs. all roles (consistency). Selected: all roles
- **Rationale for Selected Option:** Enforce consistency and predictability
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Overwrite/conflicts; Mitigation: append-only edits

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Updated role process docs with PDCA + linking policy
  - Created PDCA files per role
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
TREE_WIDTH=2 tree -a -I 'node_modules|.git' scrum.pmo/roles | sed -n '1,60p'
rg -n "PDCA Requirement \(Shared\)|Linking Policy" scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md | sed -n '1,40p'
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Confirmed presence of PDCA and linking sections in updated processes
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> yes, that was the goal that you do the pdca log from now on
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
rg -n "## PDCA Requirement \(Shared\)" scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md
rg -n "## Linking Policy" scrum.pmo/roles/*/process.md
```
