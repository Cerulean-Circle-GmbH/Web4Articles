## Plan
- Objective: Permanently change MD link style to "GitHub: relative" and refactor all relevant files.

## Do
- Identified affected files (ontology indexes, index.md, PDCA logs, processes).
- Prepared edits to convert "relative -> GitHub" to "GitHub: relative" format.

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
