# PDCA — OntologyAgent — 2025-08-13 (UTC 09:12)

## Plan
- Objective: Enhance the PDCA Plan section to include the agent’s thinking process.
- Scope: Shared PDCA template; OntologyAgent and ResearchAgent processes.
- Targets (metrics): Template and processes updated today; future PDCA entries include enhanced Plan by default.
- Inputs: `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md`, `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md`, `scrum.pmo/roles/ResearchAgent/process.md`.
- Acceptance Criteria: Template contains Plan subsections; both processes mandate enhanced Plan content.
- Assumptions: All background agents will inherit the shared template; no conflicts with existing policies.
- Constraints: Keep docs concise and consistent; avoid breaking existing links.
- Options Considered:
  - A) Only update template (pro: minimal edits; con: roles might not enforce)
  - B) Update template + role processes (pro: enforced; con: more edits)
- Rationale: Choose B to ensure consistent enforcement across agents.
- Risks and Mitigations: Risk of drift; mitigation via ScrumMaster PDCA enforcement already added.

## Do
- Updated shared template Plan subsections.
- Added enhanced Plan requirement to OntologyAgent and ResearchAgent processes.

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
