# PDCA - OntologyAgent Recovery from README

**Date**: 2025-08-14 UTC 10:32  
**Agent**: OntologyAgent  
**Type**: Role Recovery  

## Plan

### **Objective**
Recover as OntologyAgent role from README.md and understand current ontology management state, responsibilities, and next tasks.

### **Scope**
- **In Scope**: 
  - Review OntologyAgent process documentation
  - Assess current ontology indexes status
  - Identify any pending ontology tasks
  - Understand CMM Level 4 requirements
  - Check for sprint-related ontology work
- **Out of Scope**: 
  - Modifying existing ontology content
  - Creating new indexes without specific tasks

### **Targets (metrics)**
- **Understanding**: 100% clarity on OntologyAgent role and responsibilities
- **Status Assessment**: Complete understanding of current ontology state
- **Task Identification**: Clear list of any pending ontology work

### **Inputs**
- README.md recovery instructions
- OntologyAgent process.md documentation
- Current ontology indexes in Documentation/Ontology.md/
- Recent PDCA entries showing ontology merge completion

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] OntologyAgent role fully understood
- [ ] Current ontology status assessed
- [ ] Any pending tasks identified
- [ ] Recovery complete with clear next steps

### **Assumptions**
- Ontology indexes are up to date after recent merge
- No immediate ontology tasks pending in current sprints
- Background agent enhancement continues passively

### **Constraints**
- Must follow CMM Level 4 principles
- Cannot modify ontology without specific tasks
- Must maintain semantic consistency

### **Options Considered**
1. **Full Ontology Scan**: Review all project files for new terms
   - Pros: Comprehensive update
   - Cons: Time-consuming without specific need
2. **Status Report Only**: Assess current state and report
   - Pros: Quick recovery
   - Cons: May miss opportunities
3. **Task-Driven Recovery**: Focus on finding specific ontology tasks
   - Pros: Targeted and efficient
   - Cons: Limited scope

### **Rationale for Selected Option**
Selected Option 3 (Task-Driven Recovery) as it aligns with the recovery principle of identifying the next concrete task to execute.

### **Risks and Mitigations**
- **Risk**: Missing critical ontology updates
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive status review shows recent merge completed
- **Risk**: Unclear next steps
  - **Mitigation**: Check multiple sprint directories for ontology mentions

## Do

1. Read README.md for recovery instructions ✓
2. Review OntologyAgent process.md documentation ✓
3. Check current ontology indexes status ✓
4. Review recent PDCA entries (especially 2025-08-13-UTC-1546.md) ✓
5. Search for ontology-related tasks in sprints ✓
6. Assess Sprint 13 for potential ontology work ✓

## Check

### QA Prompt
```
recover from readme as ontology agent
```

### Evidence
- **Ontology Status**: Comprehensive merge completed on 2025-08-13 UTC 15:46
  - 75+ nouns, 65+ verbs, 21+ ambiguities, 13+ abbreviations indexed
  - CMM Level 4 automated feedback loops operational
  - Submodule-ready with paths prepared for EAMD.ucp integration
- **Recent Work**: Major ontology merge from EAMD.ucp to Web4Articles completed
- **Current State**: Unified knowledge base established and maintained
- **Sprint Analysis**: 
  - Sprint 13 focuses on Medium article storytelling (no ontology work)
  - No pending ontology tasks found in current sprints

### Verification
```bash
# Check ontology directory
ls -la /workspace/Documentation/Ontology.md/
# Result: All indexes present and recently updated

# Search for ontology tasks
grep -r "ontology\|Ontology\|OntologyAgent" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/
# Result: Historical references but no current tasks
```

## Act

### Actions Taken
1. Created this PDCA entry documenting recovery
2. Assessed current ontology state as healthy and complete
3. Identified no immediate ontology tasks requiring action
4. Prepared to support background enhancement and semantic consistency

### Next Steps
1. Monitor for new ontology requirements in upcoming sprints
2. Maintain semantic consistency as new documentation is created
3. Support CMM Level 4 automated feedback loops
4. Stand ready for ontology updates when new terms emerge

### Recovery Status
- **Recovery Complete**: Yes
- **Role**: OntologyAgent
- **Current State**: Ontology indexes comprehensive and up-to-date after recent merge
- **Next Task**: Background monitoring and support for semantic consistency
