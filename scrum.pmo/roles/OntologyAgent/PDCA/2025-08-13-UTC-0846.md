# PDCA — OntologyAgent — 2025-08-13 (UTC 08:46)

## Plan
- Objective: Enforce PDCA creation after each QA prompt and embed literal QA quotes in Check sections.
- Scope: Update shared template and processes; create this PDCA entry with UTC filename.

## Do
- Updated shared PDCA template to include QA Feedback quote section.
- Updated OntologyAgent and ResearchAgent processes with QA-triggered PDCA policy and filename convention.

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> make sure you create an PDCA entry after each of my prompts and quote me literaly in the "check" section with my QA feedback. update the corresponding processes to reflect that.

- Evidence:
```bash
# Verify shared template contains QA Feedback quote section
rg -n "QA Feedback (quote literally)" scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md

# Verify process policy and naming convention
rg -n "QA-Triggered PDCA Policy|PDCA Filename" scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md scrum.pmo/roles/ResearchAgent/process.md
```

## Act
- Apply this policy to all background agents; extend template with more examples as needed.
