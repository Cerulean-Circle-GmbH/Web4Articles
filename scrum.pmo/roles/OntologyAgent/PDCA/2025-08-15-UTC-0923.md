# PDCA - Recovery from README Context
[Back to PDCA Index](../)

**Date**: 2025-08-15 UTC 09:23  
**Agent**: OntologyAgent  
**Type**: Recovery and Context Analysis

## Plan

### **Objective**
Recover from the OntologyAgent README context provided by the user and establish current project state for continued operation according to CMM Level 4 principles.

### **Scope**
- **In Scope**:
  - Analyze provided OntologyAgent context from cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu project
  - Understand current Web4Articles project structure and OntologyAgent role
  - Identify any pending recovery tasks or PDCA cycles
  - Create PDCA entry documenting recovery process
  - Determine next actions for OntologyAgent role
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Modifications to the cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu project
  - Changes to core OntologyAgent process definitions

### **Targets (metrics)**
- **Recovery Completion**: 100% context analysis and understanding
- **PDCA Compliance**: Full adherence to OntologyAgent PDCA requirements
- **Process Alignment**: Complete alignment with Web4Articles OntologyAgent process

### **Inputs**
- User-provided OntologyAgent.md from cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu project
- Current Web4Articles project state and git history
- OntologyAgent process.md and PDCA templates
- Latest PDCA entries showing recent ontology work

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Context from README fully analyzed and understood
- [ ] Current project state accurately assessed
- [ ] PDCA entry created with proper UTC naming
- [ ] Next actions clearly identified
- [ ] Recovery process documented for future reference

### **Assumptions**
- User wants to continue OntologyAgent work in Web4Articles project
- Previous PDCA cycles provide relevant context
- Git history shows recent project activities
- OntologyAgent role should follow established processes

### **Constraints**
- Must work within current Web4Articles project structure
- Cannot modify external cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu project
- Must follow established PDCA and recovery protocols
- Should maintain continuity with previous work

### **Options Considered**
1. **Direct Application**: Apply cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu context directly
   - **Pros**: Uses provided context exactly
   - **Cons**: May not fit Web4Articles project structure
2. **Context Translation**: Translate concepts to Web4Articles context
   - **Pros**: Better fit for current project
   - **Cons**: May lose specific details
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Extract relevant patterns while adapting to local context
   - **Pros**: Balances specificity with applicability
   - **Cons**: Requires careful analysis

### **Rationale for Selected Option**
Selected **Option 3: Hybrid Approach** because:
- Preserves valuable methodology from cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu
- Adapts to Web4Articles specific structure and needs
- Maintains CMM Level 4 principles across contexts
- Enables continuity with existing PDCA cycles

### **Risks and Mitigations**
- **Risk**: Confusion between project contexts
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation of which project is active
- **Risk**: Missing important recovery steps
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic review of all available information
- **Risk**: Breaking existing workflows
  - **Mitigation**: Careful integration with current processes

## Do

### **Actions Taken**
1. **Context Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Analyzed provided OntologyAgent.md from cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu
   # Key findings:
   # - Dual-context architecture for Atlassian link resolution
   # - PDCA methodology central to operations
   # - Git-based safety protocols emphasized
   # - Current on Cycle 8 focusing on web testing
   ```

2. **Project State Assessment**:
   ```bash
   # Checked current working directory
   pwd  # Result: /workspace (Web4Articles project)
   
   # Verified git status
   git status  # Result: On branch cursor/recover-from-readme-file-0c0e, clean
   
   # Reviewed recent commits
   git log --oneline -10  # Found recent refactoring and component work
   
   # Listed relevant branches
   git branch -a | grep -E "(release|feature|cursor)"
   ```

3. **OntologyAgent Review**:
   ```bash
   # Found OntologyAgent role in Web4Articles
   grep -l "OntologyAgent" scrum.pmo/roles/*
   
   # Read OntologyAgent process
   cat scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md
   
   # Listed PDCA entries
   ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/PDCA/
   
   # Read latest PDCA (2025-08-13-UTC-1546.md)
   # Found: Successful ontology merge from EAMD.ucp
   ```

### **Findings Summary**
- Web4Articles has active OntologyAgent role with comprehensive process documentation
- Latest work involved merging ontology from EAMD.ucp project (180+ terms)
- PDCA methodology actively used with 12 entries since August 10
- Project follows CMM Level 4 principles with automated feedback loops
- Current state: Post-merge, ready for continued ontology operations

## Check

### **Verification Results**
- **Context Understanding**: ✅ Both projects use OntologyAgent with PDCA methodology
- **Project Differentiation**: ✅ Clear separation between projects identified
- **Process Alignment**: ✅ Web4Articles OntologyAgent process comprehensive and active
- **Recovery Readiness**: ✅ Clean git state, recent successful work documented

### **Quality Checks**
- [x] PDCA entry follows required template structure
- [x] User query analyzed: "recover from readme"
- [x] Current project state accurately documented
- [x] Next steps clearly identified
- [x] CMM Level 4 principles maintained

### **User Query Quote**
> "recover from readme"

## Act

### **Process Improvements**
- **Cross-Project Learning**: cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu patterns can inform Web4Articles work
- **Recovery Clarity**: Need clear differentiation when multiple project contexts exist
- **PDCA Continuity**: Maintaining PDCA chain ensures knowledge preservation

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Commit this PDCA entry**: Document recovery completion
2. **Review pending ontology tasks**: Check for any incomplete work
3. **Update project index**: Ensure recent changes reflected
4. **Plan next ontology cycle**: Based on project needs

### **Lessons Learned**
- Recovery from external context requires careful translation
- PDCA methodology provides excellent continuity mechanism
- Clear project boundaries prevent context confusion
- Git-based workflows enable reliable recovery

### **Recommendations**
- Continue using PDCA methodology for all significant actions
- Maintain clear project context in all documentation
- Use git commits as safety checkpoints
- Apply CMM Level 4 feedback loops to ontology management
