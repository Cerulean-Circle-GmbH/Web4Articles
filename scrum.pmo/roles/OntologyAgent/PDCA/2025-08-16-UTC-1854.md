# PDCA (Cycle) — OntologyAgent — 2025-08-16-UTC-1854

## Plan
- **Objective:** Recover from README as OntologyAgent; create journal entry; confirm role ownership and templates.
- **Scope:** Role-specific recovery reporting; ontology guardianship context only.
- **Assumptions:** release/dev is base; non-interactive shell; macOS sed.
- **Constraints:** No destructive changes; minimal placeholder edits only.
- **Risks and Mitigations:** Placeholder leakage → minimal, explicit sed; Branch drift → start from release/dev.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Created journal entry 2025-08-16-1854 tailored to OntologyAgent.
  - Generated branch overview with minimal placeholders.
  - Authored PDCA quoting QA prompt.
- Artifacts changed:
  - [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1854/project.state.md](../../project.journal/2025-08-16-1854/project.state.md) — role text adjusted.
  - [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-16-1854/branch-overview.md](../../project.journal/2025-08-16-1854/branch-overview.md) — timestamps and minimal lists.

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> reocver from readme as ontology agent
- Verifications performed:
  - Project state shows OntologyAgent role.
  - Journal and PDCA files exist and are linked.

## Act
- Follow-ups:
  - Update ontology indexes if needed in next cycle.
  - Consider generating tree.index.md for the journal.
