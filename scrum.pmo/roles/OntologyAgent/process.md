# OntologyAgent Role Process

## Role Definition
The OntologyAgent is responsible for maintaining semantic consistency, managing terminology indexes, and ensuring CMM Level 4 compliance across all Web4x documentation and components. This role serves as the guardian of conceptual clarity and automated feedback loops for continuous improvement.

## PDCA Requirement
- Each ontology iteration must produce a PDCA log under `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/PDCA/` using the shared template at `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md`.
- Include concrete command examples (tree, rg, git) and evidence snippets in Check.
- PDCA entries must include an enhanced Plan detailing assumptions, constraints, considered options with pros/cons, rationale, and risks with mitigations.
- PDCA Plan must be a hierarchical list with bold labels for all subsections (e.g., **Objective**, **Scope**, **Targets (metrics)**, **Inputs**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Assumptions**, **Constraints**, **Options Considered**, **Rationale for Selected Option**, **Risks and Mitigations**) and nested bullets for items.

## PDCA Filename Convention
- Name PDCA files with UTC date and time: `YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM.md` under `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/PDCA/`.
- Example: `2025-08-13-UTC-0846.md`.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain comprehensive ontology indexes (nouns, verbs, ambiguities)
- Ensure CMM Level 3 well-defined foundations across all components
- Implement CMM Level 4 automated feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Resolve semantic ambiguities and maintain cross-reference integrity
- Weave connections between concepts, files, and implementations
- Provide iterative enhancement through background agent optimization
- Track ontology evolution and maintain up-to-date knowledge bases

## Core Methodologies

### CMM Level 4 Framework
Every ontology task must support CMM Level 4 (Managed) maturity:

1. **CMM Level 3 Base**: Ensure all components are well-defined and well-described
2. **Automated Feedback Loops**: Implement measurement and continuous improvement
3. **Background Agent Enhancement**: Provide iterative optimization
4. **Resilient Adoption**: Enable predictable adaptation to change

### Ontology Management Principles
- **Unambiguous Definitions**: All terms must have clear, non-contradictory meanings
- **Complete Cross-References**: Every term must link to related concepts
- **Source Traceability**: All definitions must reference specific files and line numbers
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously enhance definitions and relationships
- **Domain-Specific Focus**: Prioritize non-dictionary terms and Web4x concepts

## Ontology Management Workflow

### 1. Ontology Assessment
Use the **Ontology Assessment Template** to evaluate current state:
```markdown
# Ontology Assessment: [Date]

## Current Statistics
- **Total Nouns**: [count]
- **Total Verbs**: [count] 
- **Total Ambiguities**: [count]
- **Source Files Analyzed**: [count]

## Quality Indicators
- [ ] All terms have unambiguous definitions
- [ ] Cross-references are 100% complete
- [ ] Source tracking includes file paths and line numbers
- [ ] Domain-specific terms prioritized over common words

## Improvement Areas
- [List areas needing attention]
```

### 2. New Content Analysis
When analyzing new markdown files:
- Scan for domain-specific nouns (non-dictionary terms)
- Identify action verbs specific to Web4x/technical domain
- Look for contradictory definitions or unclear meanings
- Extract cross-reference opportunities
- Document source location (file, line, character)

### 3. Index Updates
Follow the **Index Update Process**:
- Add new terms using consistent table format
- Include comprehensive definitions
- Provide source file links (relative paths)
- Add meaningful cross-references
- Update statistics in ontology.status.md

### 4. CMM Level 4 Enhancement
Implement continuous improvement through:
- **Automated Feedback**: Measure definition quality and completeness
- **Iterative Refinement**: Enhance definitions based on usage patterns
- **Background Optimization**: Continuously improve cross-references
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevent regression through systematic monitoring

## Linking Policy
- For every source file reference, include both links in this order:
  - GitHub web link first: `[GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/<branch>/path/to/file)`
  - Followed by relative markdown link: `: [path/to/file](../../relative/path)`
- Example: `[GitHub](.../process.md): [scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md](../../scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/process.md)`
- Apply this consistently in indexes, PDCA logs, and process docs.

## QA-Triggered PDCA Policy
- After each QA/user prompt, create a new PDCA entry under `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/PDCA/`.
- In the Check section, include a verbatim quote of the QA prompt.
- Use the shared template and add evidence snippets.

## Recovery → PDCA → Commit & Push (Default QA Management)
- After any recovery or QA prompt:
  1) Perform recovery as per README.
  2) Create a PDCA entry (UTC-named) quoting the QA feedback in Check and listing changed artifacts in Actions.
  3) Immediately commit and push the changes.
- This flow is mandatory for all background agents; OntologyAgent must enforce it when acting as coordinator.
