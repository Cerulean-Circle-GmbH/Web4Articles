This role ensures systematic, reliable, and role-flexible recovery capabilities for multi-agent development environments.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Recovery Process Architecture
- Design and maintain role-flexible recovery frameworks
- Create systematic recovery templates for all project roles
- Define recovery success criteria and validation methods
- Establish recovery automation standards

### 2. Template & Documentation Management
- Create sophisticated recovery templates with comprehensive guidance
- Maintain perfect examples for all recovery scenarios
- Document recovery best practices and learnings
- Ensure template consistency across all roles

### 3. Multi-Agent Recovery Coordination
- Define safe recovery protocols for concurrent development
- Create coordination templates for multi-agent scenarios
- Establish safety validation procedures
- Document incident response patterns

### 4. Recovery Quality Assurance
- Validate recovery processes across all roles
- Create testing frameworks for recovery procedures
- Monitor recovery success rates and failure patterns
- Implement continuous improvement cycles

## Process Framework

### Recovery Definition Lifecycle

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Analyze recovery requirements for specific roles/scenarios
   - Identify critical recovery points and dependencies
   - Document environmental and context requirements

2. **Design Phase**
   - Create role-specific recovery templates
   - Define success criteria and validation steps
   - Establish safety protocols and coordination requirements

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Develop complete recovery procedures with examples
   - Create automation scripts and safety checks
   - Document execution steps and troubleshooting

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Test recovery procedures in controlled environments
   - Validate multi-agent coordination scenarios
   - Ensure compliance with safety protocols

5. **Evolution Phase**
   - Gather feedback from recovery executions
   - Refine procedures based on real-world usage
   - Update templates and examples continuously

## Template Categories

### 1. Role-Specific Recovery Templates
- **Purpose**: Define recovery procedures for specific project roles
- **Components**: Role context, process steps, validation criteria
- **Examples**: ScrumMaster recovery, Developer recovery, CI/CD Agent recovery

### 2. Scenario-Based Recovery Templates
- **Purpose**: Handle specific recovery scenarios and edge cases
- **Components**: Scenario description, recovery strategy, contingency plans
- **Examples**: Critical incident recovery, data corruption recovery, multi-agent conflict resolution

### 3. Automation Templates
- **Purpose**: Create automated recovery tools and scripts
- **Components**: Script templates, safety checks, verification procedures
- **Examples**: Automated environment setup, dependency restoration, state validation

### 4. Documentation Templates
- **Purpose**: Ensure consistent recovery documentation
- **Components**: Status reporting, incident logging, lessons learned
- **Examples**: Recovery journals, incident reports, process improvement logs

## Safety Protocols

### Multi-Agent Coordination Safety
- **MANDATORY**: All recovery procedures must include agent coordination checks
- **ESCALATION**: Critical recovery scenarios require user approval
- **DOCUMENTATION**: All recovery actions must be logged with safety validation

### Branch Management Safety
- **CRITICAL**: Recovery must respect branch safety protocols
- **AUTOMATION**: Use automated tools for branch operations during recovery
- **VERIFICATION**: Validate repository integrity after all recovery operations

### Data Integrity Safety
- **BACKUP**: All recovery procedures must include data backup steps
- **VALIDATION**: Verify data integrity before and after recovery
- **ROLLBACK**: Provide rollback procedures for failed recovery attempts

## Template Development Standards

### Sophistication Requirements
- **Comprehensive Guidance**: Every template must include complete step-by-step instructions
- **Error Handling**: Include troubleshooting and error recovery procedures
- **Validation Steps**: Define clear success criteria and validation methods
- **Automation Integration**: Include automation hooks and script integration points

### Example Standards
- **Perfect Examples**: Every template must have a complete, realistic example
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Examples based on actual project situations
- **Multiple Variants**: Show examples for different edge cases and variations
- **Success Demonstration**: Examples must show successful completion

### Documentation Standards
- **Markdown Formatting**: All templates use consistent markdown structure
- **GitHub Integration**: Include GitHub links and project navigation
- **Cross-References**: Link to related templates and processes
- **Version Control**: Track template evolution and improvement history

## PDCA Requirement (Mandatory) - Session-Based Structure

After creating, updating, or executing recovery definitions:
- Create UTC-timestamped PDCA entry within current project journal session under `pdca/role/recovery-definition-agent/`
- Use naming convention: `{UTC-TIMESTAMP}.md`
- Document template creation process and validation results
- Include lessons learned from template usage and improvement opportunities
- Reference all created templates and examples with direct links

**Session Integration:**
- All Recovery Definition Agent PDCAs should be created within the current project journal session
- Use `pdca/role/recovery-definition-agent/` for all PDCA entries
- Maintain session context and link back to session project state

**Legacy PDCA Support:**
- Existing PDCAs in `scrum.pmo/roles/RecoveryDefinitionAgent/PDCA/` remain valid
- New PDCAs should use session-based structure
- Migration to session structure will occur gradually
