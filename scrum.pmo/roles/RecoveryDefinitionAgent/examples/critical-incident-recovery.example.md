# Critical Incident Recovery Example (Perfect Implementation)

## Scenario: Multi-Agent Branch Conflict with Data Corruption

### Scenario Description
- **Context**: Multiple agents simultaneously working on critical project deliverable, branch operations performed without coordination, resulting in git repository corruption and loss of recent work
- **Triggers**: Git merge conflicts, uncommitted work loss, branch history inconsistencies, agent coordination failure
- **Scope of Impact**: All active development, sprint deliverables at risk, team coordination compromised
- **Urgency Level**: Critical

### Affected Components
- **Roles**: All active development roles (ScrumMaster, Developer, PO, Tester, CI/CD Agent)
- **Systems**: Git repository, development environment, CI/CD pipeline, project documentation
- **Data**: Recent commits, uncommitted work, branch history, project state documentation
- **Workflows**: All development workflows, release processes, team coordination protocols

### Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risks**: Data loss, sprint failure, delivery timeline impact, team morale damage
- **Secondary Risks**: Stakeholder confidence loss, process breakdown, future coordination issues
- **Business Impact**: High - potential sprint failure and delivery delay
- **Technical Impact**: Critical - core development infrastructure compromised

## Detection and Initial Assessment

### Scenario Recognition
- **Symptoms Checklist**:
  - [x] Git repository shows merge conflicts on critical branches
  - [x] Multiple agents report lost work or inconsistent state
  - [x] Branch history shows unexpected divergence or missing commits
  - [x] CI/CD pipeline failures due to repository issues

### Impact Assessment Framework
1. **Immediate Impact Analysis**
   - Affected team members: 3-4 agents actively working on sprint deliverables
   - System availability: Git repository partially corrupted, development environments inconsistent
   - Data integrity: Recent commits potentially lost, branch history compromised
   - Timeline impact: Sprint delivery at risk, 2-3 days potential delay

2. **Severity Classification**
   - [x] **Critical**: Sprint deliverables at risk, multiple team members affected, data loss potential

## Recovery Strategy Framework

### Strategic Approach
- **Primary Strategy**: Immediate work preservation, repository state reconstruction, coordinated recovery with all affected agents
- **Fallback Strategy**: Repository rollback to last known good state, work reconstruction from backups
- **Recovery Objectives**: Preserve maximum amount of recent work, restore repository integrity, re-establish team coordination
- **Success Metrics**: All recent work recovered or reconstructed, repository fully functional, team coordination restored

### Resource Requirements
- **Personnel**: All affected agents (ScrumMaster coordination, Developer technical lead, CI/CD Agent for automation)
- **Tools**: Git advanced recovery tools, backup systems, communication channels, incident management
- **Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours for full recovery including validation
- **External Dependencies**: QA user availability for critical decisions, backup system access

### Communication Plan
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Immediate QA user notification with impact assessment and recovery timeline
- **Team Coordination**: Emergency coordination channel, hourly status updates, clear role assignments
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time recovery progress, risk mitigation status, revised delivery timeline
- **Documentation Requirements**: Complete incident log, lessons learned, process improvements

## Recovery Execution Procedures

### Phase 1: Stabilization (30 minutes)
1. **Stop All Active Work and Assess Damage**
   - **Action**: Immediately halt all agent operations, document current repository state, identify scope of corruption
   - **Expected Outcome**: Clear understanding of damage scope, all agents coordinated and standing by
   - **Validation**: Repository state documented, all agents confirmed stopped, damage assessment complete
   - **Rollback Plan**: If assessment shows total corruption, immediate rollback to last backup

2. **Establish Emergency Coordination**
   - **Action**: Set up dedicated incident communication channel, assign recovery coordinator, establish status reporting schedule
   - **Expected Outcome**: Clear command structure, regular communication established, roles defined
   - **Validation**: All team members in communication channel, coordinator assigned, first status update completed
   - **Rollback Plan**: Escalate to QA user if coordination cannot be established

### Phase 2: Recovery Implementation (2-3 hours)
1. **Repository State Analysis and Backup**
   - **Action**: Create complete backup of current corrupted state, analyze git history, identify recoverable commits
   - **Expected Outcome**: Current state preserved, recoverable work identified, recovery plan established
   - **Validation**: Backup verified, commit analysis completed, recovery strategy confirmed
   - **Dependencies**: Git advanced tools, backup storage availability

2. **Work Preservation and Reconstruction**
   - **Action**: Extract uncommitted work from all agents, identify lost commits, reconstruct missing work from available sources
   - **Expected Outcome**: Maximum work preserved, clear plan for reconstructing lost items
   - **Validation**: All extractable work preserved, reconstruction plan validated with team
   - **Dependencies**: Agent cooperation, local backup availability, commit history analysis

3. **Repository Reconstruction**
   - **Action**: Create clean repository branch, systematically apply recovered commits, resolve conflicts with team input
   - **Expected Outcome**: Clean repository with maximum work preserved, consistent history
   - **Validation**: Repository integrity verified, all recovered work properly integrated
   - **Dependencies**: Team consensus on conflict resolution, technical validation

### Phase 3: Verification and Validation (1 hour)
1. **Functional Testing of Recovered Repository**
   - **Verification Method**: Complete build and test cycle, manual verification of critical features
   - **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, build successful, critical functionality verified
   - **Failure Response**: Identify specific issues, targeted fixes, re-verification cycle

2. **Team Validation of Recovered Work**
   - **Verification Method**: Each agent validates their recovered work, confirms completeness and accuracy
   - **Success Criteria**: All agents confirm satisfactory work recovery, no critical work missing
   - **Failure Response**: Document missing work, plan reconstruction or re-implementation

### Phase 4: Restoration and Cleanup (1 hour)
1. **Repository Protection and Process Updates**
   - **Action**: Implement branch protection rules, update CI/CD safety checks, document new coordination protocols
   - **Validation**: Protection rules active, safety checks functional, team trained on new protocols
   - **Cleanup Tasks**: Remove temporary files, cleanup backup data, update documentation

2. **Team Coordination Restoration**
   - **Action**: Re-establish normal development workflow, update project status, communicate resolution to stakeholders
   - **Validation**: Normal workflow resumed, project status updated, stakeholder confidence restored
   - **Cleanup Tasks**: Close incident communication channel, file incident report, schedule lessons learned session

## Contingency Plans

### Scenario: Recovery Attempts Fail, Data Loss Confirmed
- **Trigger Conditions**: Technical recovery methods unsuccessful, critical work cannot be reconstructed
- **Alternative Actions**: Implement sprint scope reduction, prioritize critical features, extend timeline
- **Resource Adjustments**: Additional development resources, extended hours authorization
- **Timeline Modifications**: Sprint extension by 3-5 days, stakeholder notification, revised delivery plan

### Scenario: Team Coordination Breakdown During Recovery
- **Trigger Conditions**: Agents unable to coordinate effectively, conflicting recovery approaches
- **Alternative Actions**: QA user direct intervention, single recovery coordinator assignment, simplified process
- **Resource Adjustments**: External facilitation, direct QA user involvement
- **Timeline Modifications**: Pause recovery for coordination resolution, revised approach

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1 Escalation**: ScrumMaster coordination difficulties → CI/CD Agent technical lead
- **Level 2 Escalation**: Technical recovery challenges → QA user involvement for decisions
- **Level 3 Escalation**: Business impact assessment → Stakeholder notification and timeline revision
- **Emergency Escalation**: Complete data loss risk → Executive stakeholder involvement

## Post-Recovery Analysis Framework

### Success Evaluation
- [x] **Primary Objectives Met**: 95% of work recovered, repository integrity restored, team coordination re-established
- [x] **Timeline Adherence**: Recovery completed in 5.5 hours (within 6-hour estimate), sprint delayed by 1 day
- [x] **Resource Utilization**: All planned resources utilized effectively, no external resources required
- [x] **Quality Standards**: Repository integrity verified, all recovered work tested, documentation complete
