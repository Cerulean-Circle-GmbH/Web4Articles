# PDCA Cycle: Recovery Definition Agent Role Creation - 2025-08-15-UTC-0909

## Plan

**Objective:** Create comprehensive Recovery Definition Agent role with sophisticated templates and perfect examples for all recovery scenarios  
**Scope:** Complete role implementation including process documentation, sophisticated templates, realistic examples, and integration with existing recovery framework  
**Targets:** 6+ sophisticated templates, 6+ perfect examples, complete role process documentation, integration with enhanced recovery system  
**Inputs:** 
- QA feedback: "wite a role as recovery.definition.agent in the role directory with sophisticated templates an a perfect filled out example for each."
- Existing enhanced recovery system with role flexibility
- Project structure and existing role templates
- CI/CD Agent safety protocols and lessons learned

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete Recovery Definition Agent role process documentation
- [ ] Sophisticated template library covering all recovery scenarios
- [ ] Perfect examples demonstrating real-world usage for each template
- [ ] Integration with existing recovery and safety frameworks
- [ ] PDCA documentation of role creation process

**Assumptions:** Role will be used to standardize and improve recovery processes across all project scenarios  
**Constraints:** Must integrate with existing role structure and follow project documentation standards  
**Options:** 
1. Basic role with simple templates
2. Comprehensive role with sophisticated templates and examples
3. Advanced role with automation integration and continuous improvement

**Rationale:** Option 2 + 3 hybrid - comprehensive templates with automation integration for maximum value  
**Risks/Mitigations:**
- Risk: Over-engineering complexity → Mitigation: Clear usage guidelines and progressive sophistication
- Risk: Templates not practical → Mitigation: Real-world examples and validation
- Risk: Integration issues → Mitigation: Careful alignment with existing frameworks
