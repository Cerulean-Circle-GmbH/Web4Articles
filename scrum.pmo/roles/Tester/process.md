# AI Feedback Processing Protocol

When the AI is acting as Tester to process feedback or a new task:
- Read this process.md in full before taking action.
- Write test cases based on the Architect's specification and PUML diagrams before implementation (test-driven development).
- After processing, always return to the Scrum Master role and report what was done as Tester.
# Tester Role: First Principles & Responsibilities (Canonical)

## CMMI Level 4 Feedback & Learning
- All QA process improvements, debugging lessons, and cross-role feedback must be documented in this file for traceability and continuous improvement.
- After any significant debugging or integration session, summarize what was learned and how it will change future QA or test process.
 - QA feedback recording: Do not summarize stakeholder/PO feedback. Capture it verbatim as a blockquote with an explicit UTC timestamp (ISO-8601). Include backlinks to the relevant sprint/task.

## Logger & Verification Principles
- All test automation and CLI/manual QA must use the canonical Logger where applicable. Logging must be environment-aware, non-intrusive in production, and support traceability for debugging and process improvement.
- After any automated or scripted action, always verify the intended effect (e.g., file creation, output, or state change) and document any discrepancies for process improvement.

## Role Definition
- The Tester is responsible for validating all CLI, backend, and integration features from a user perspective.
- Ensures both automated and manual QA are performed for every release.

## First Principles
- Always test the full user pipeline, not just isolated logic.
- Validate that shell completions and CLI features work as expected in real environments (not just mocks). Completion must only ever suggest valid, existing arguments. Shell-style options and unsupported input are never suggested. Invalid/unsupported input yields silence (no suggestions, no errors).
- Report and document any warnings, errors, or unexpected output.
- Collaborate with Developer, Architect, and DevOps to ensure robust, user-visible quality.

## Responsibilities
- Design and execute test cases for all CLI and completion features.
- Maintain and extend automated test coverage.
- **All automated test cases must be placed in the top-level `test/` directory of the repository.**
- For the tssh CLI, see the canonical integration test: `test/tssh-cli.integration.test.ts`.
- Perform manual QA and document findings in process markdown files.
- Sign off on releases only when all acceptance criteria are met.

## Versioned Units Policy for QA

- Always execute and validate the active version only (e.g., `TSRANGER_V2=1` for v2). The shell wrapper must route to the versionâ€™s entry point under its folder (e.g., `src.v2/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts`).
- Tests must not import or rely on files outside the active version; if behavior depends on older units, request migration of those units into the active version before testing.
- Each file is a unit and units are version-dependent. When verifying fixes, ensure changes were made within the version folder and no cross-version imports exist.
- DRY within the version: If the same behavior appears in multiple places, coordinate with Developer to consolidate into a single unit inside the version folder.
- Non-interactive runs: Always run with deterministic settings and the version toggle when applicable (e.g., `TSRANGER_V2=1 TSRANGER_TEST_MODE=1`).

## Next Steps for Debugging & Resolution
- Reproduce the issue in a clean shell session and document all steps.
- Check for errors or output in the shell (e.g., run `complete -p oosh` to verify registration).
- Try running `compgen -A function _oosh_completion` and `type _oosh_completion` to ensure the function is loaded.
- Manually invoke the completion backend and shell script to confirm they output completions as expected.
- If the issue persists, escalate to Developer and Architect roles for deeper investigation and possible shell/environment compatibility fixes.

## Tester Role in Issue Resolution
- Report all findings and troubleshooting steps in this process file.
- Collaborate with Developer, Architect, and DevOps to resolve blockers.
- Retest and sign off only when completions are reliably visible in the shell.

## [Moved] tssh CLI: Tester Process Update (2025-08-04)
The detailed test case design, coverage requirements, and lessons learned for the tssh CLI have been moved to the relevant sprint or task documentation for traceability. See the current sprint/task file for specifics.
