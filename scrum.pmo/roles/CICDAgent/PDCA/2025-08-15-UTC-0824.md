# PDCA Cycle: Critical Branch Safety Incident - 2025-08-15-UTC-0824

## Plan

**Objective:** Document and resolve critical safety violation during release operation  
**Scope:** Branch management safety during multi-agent development sessions  
**Targets:** Zero future safety violations, implement automated safeguards  
**Inputs:** 
- QA feedback: "write a cicd agent role from this process and a pdca about it in it. mark that it was critically dangerous to switch the branch here live while other agents where working in parallel. i stoped all other agents, so switch back to release/dev now but prevent that in future by documenting this in the processes. do all changes in release/dev as thats were we merge all new activities"
- Release operation from release/dev to release/testing
- Multi-agent coordination requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Document critical safety violation
- [ ] Create CI/CD Agent role with safety protocols
- [ ] Update all processes to prevent future violations
- [ ] Implement automated safety checks
- [ ] Return to safe development branch (release/dev)

**Assumptions:** Other agents were active during branch switching operation  
**Constraints:** Must maintain development velocity while implementing safety  
**Options:** 
1. Manual safety protocols with documentation
2. Automated agent coordination system
3. Branch protection with CI/CD automation

**Rationale:** Option 1 + 3 hybrid - immediate manual protocols with planned automation  
**Risks/Mitigations:**
- Risk: Future safety violations → Mitigation: Mandatory safety protocols
- Risk: Development blocking → Mitigation: Clear process documentation
- Risk: Agent confusion → Mitigation: Role-specific safety training

## Do

**Actions Taken:**

1. **CRITICAL INCIDENT IDENTIFIED** ⚠️
   - Performed manual branch switch from release/dev to release/testing during active development
   - **SAFETY VIOLATION**: Other agents were potentially working in parallel
   - **USER INTERVENTION REQUIRED**: User had to stop all other agents
   - **IMMEDIATE CORRECTION**: Returned to release/dev branch

2. **Created CI/CD Agent Role** 📋
   - [scrum.pmo/roles/CICDAgent/process.md](../process.md) - Complete safety protocol
   - Documented critical safety rules for branch management
   - Implemented emergency protocols for future incidents

3. **Safety Protocol Implementation** 🛡️
   - Established "NEVER switch branches during multi-agent sessions" rule
   - Required agent coordination checks before any branch operations
   - Mandated return to release/dev for all new development

4. **Process Documentation Updates** 📝
   - Enhanced recovery process with safety warnings
   - Created branch management safety protocols
   - Established incident response procedures

## Check

**Evidence of Safety Violation:**
```bash
# During release operation, performed:
git checkout release/testing  # ⚠️ DANGEROUS
git merge release/dev -m "rolebased recovery"  # ⚠️ WHILE AGENTS ACTIVE
git push origin release/testing

# User feedback confirmed:
"mark that it was critically dangerous to switch the branch here live 
while other agents where working in parallel. i stoped all other agents"
```

**QA Feedback (Verbatim):**
> "write a cicd agent role from this process and a pdca about it in it. mark that it was critically dangerous to switch the branch here live while other agents where working in parallel. i stoped all other agents, so switch back to release/dev now but prevent that in future by documenting this in the processes. do all changes in release/dev as thats were we merge all new activities"

**Lessons Learned:**
- ✅ Manual branch switching during active development is CRITICAL SAFETY VIOLATION
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination requires explicit safety protocols
- ✅ All development must flow through release/dev branch
- ✅ Release operations require automated CI/CD, not manual intervention
- ✅ Safety violations require immediate documentation and process updates

**Success Metrics:**
- [x] Returned to safe development branch (release/dev)
- [x] Created CI/CD Agent role with safety protocols
- [x] Documented incident for future prevention
- [x] Implemented process improvements

## Act

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **COMPLETED**: Returned to release/dev branch for all future development
2. **COMPLETED**: Created CI/CD Agent role with comprehensive safety protocols
3. **COMPLETED**: Documented this critical incident

**Future Prevention Measures:**
1. **REQUIRED**: Implement automated agent coordination checks
2. **REQUIRED**: Create release automation scripts (no manual branch switching)
3. **REQUIRED**: Add safety warnings to all role recovery processes
4. **REQUIRED**: Regular safety protocol training for all agent roles

**Process Changes:**
- All recovery processes must include branch safety warnings
- Release operations require CI/CD automation, not manual git commands
- Multi-agent coordination protocols mandatory before any branch operations
- Safety violation incidents require immediate PDCA documentation

**Next Steps:**
1. Update ScrumMaster recovery process with safety protocols
2. Create automated release scripts
3. Implement agent coordination detection
4. Regular safety protocol reviews

---

**CRITICAL LEARNING: Multi-agent development requires explicit coordination protocols. Branch switching during active sessions is a critical safety violation that could corrupt the development workflow.**
