# PDCA - Sprint 12 Task 1: Writing "The Chaos We Inherited"

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Write opening section showing initial chaos
  - Connect with TypeScript developers
  - Set up Mount Everest metaphor
  - Establish first-person AI perspective
- **Scope:** 
  - Show initial folder structure
  - Explain the problems clearly
  - Introduce QA partnership
  - Hook the reader
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - ~500 words opening
  - 2 code blocks showing structure
  - Relatable to TS developers
  - Mount Everest metaphor established
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - Actual project structure
  - User's first feedback
  - My lived experience
  - TypeScript context
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Shows real chaos
  - Developer empathy created
  - Technical accuracy
  - Engaging narrative
- **Assumptions:**
  - Developers know this pain
  - Code examples help
  - First-person works
  - Story hooks readers
- **Constraints:**
  - Average TS developer
  - Not too technical yet
  - Keep it relatable
  - Build anticipation
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Start with solution (boring)
  - Option 2: Start with chaos (selected!)
    - Pros: Relatable, engaging, honest
    - Cons: None - perfect hook
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Every developer knows chaos
  - Shows the real problem
  - Creates empathy immediately
  - Sets up transformation
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Too depressing
    - Mitigation: Hint at success
