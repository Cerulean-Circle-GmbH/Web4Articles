### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Simple corrections to existing content maintaining narrative flow and quality.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-06-UTC-2130)**
```quote
keep it as it is, but al numbers in the text must be numbers not text. and TRON is as one as you and not a they. just keep the text and change the two flaws. v3. pdca
```

### **My Answer**
Created v3 with only the 2 specific corrections requested: converted all written numbers to digits and changed TRON pronouns from they/them to he/him throughout. Maintained all narrative content and structure exactly as v2.

**Learning Applied:** Precision corrections require systematic attention to specific details while preserving overall content quality.
