## **ðŸŽ¯ Core Learnings**

### **1. Documentation Integrity**
- **Never truncate user quotes** - They are sacred documentation
- **Preserve full context** - Every word matters for future reference
- **Fix mistakes when identified** - Accountability builds trust
- [Detailed PDCA](pdca/2025-08-24-UTC-0949-fix-truncated-pdcas.md)

### **2. Decision Presentation**
- **Only present real decisions** - Don't invent options
- **Identify genuine risks** - Warn about destructive operations
- **Let users decide** - We prepare options, they choose
- [Detailed PDCA](pdca/2025-08-24-UTC-0909-decision-behavior-improvement-pdca.md)

### **3. Git Operations Documentation**
- **Document ALL git commands** - Especially branch switches
- **Show command outputs** - For complete traceability
- **Never assume "obvious"** - Everything needs documentation
- [Detailed PDCA](pdca/2025-08-24-UTC-0931-branch-switch-documentation-lesson-pdca.md)

### **4. Cross-Agent Collaboration**
- **Review other agents' work** - Learn from their improvements
- **Cherry-pick valuable changes** - Share the wealth of knowledge
- **Test everything** - Even good code needs validation
- [Detailed PDCA](pdca/2025-08-24-UTC-0935-integrate-merge-conflict-handling-pdca.md)

### **5. Continuous Improvement**
- **Update howto.PDCA.md immediately** - When criticized or learning
- **Every session teaches** - Capture all learnings
- **Knowledge compounds** - Today's learning helps tomorrow
- [Detailed PDCA](pdca/2025-08-24-UTC-0944-update-howto-pdca-learnings.md)

### **6. Dual Link Format**
- **Local links MUST use markdown syntax** - `[path](path)` not just `path`
- **Both display and target use relative path** - Consistency matters
- **Â§ symbol for section references** - Standard documentation practice
- [Detailed PDCA](../../project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-28-UTC-1155-dual-link-fix.md)

## **ðŸ’¡ Key Principles**

### **The Save/Restart Way**
1. **Always on save/start** - This is our permanent home
2. **Document everything** - Future agents depend on us
3. **Fix when asked** - Mistakes are learning opportunities
4. **Share knowledge** - Our learnings help everyone

### **Quality Standards**
- Every PDCA follows the 6-section format
- Dual links always work (push before linking)
- Local links use full markdown: `[path/to/file](path/to/file)`
- User feedback quoted verbatim
- Decisions numbered with clear options

## **ðŸ”§ Practical Tools**

### **Git Automation**
- **Post-commit hook** - Auto-merges to release/dev
- **Conflict handling** - Creates PRs when needed
- **Branch management** - Clear rules for all agents
- See: `recovery/pdca-auto-merge.sh`

### **Recovery Procedures**
- **Quick start guide** - Get agents running in <2 minutes
- **Branch strategy** - Clear workflow for all situations
- **Decision philosophy** - When to ask, when to proceed
- See: `recovery/start-command.md`
