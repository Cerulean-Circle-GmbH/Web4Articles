# Save/Restart Agent Process Documentation

## Agent Recovery Process

### Overview
When an agent expires, it can be resubmitted with the same RequestID, but it will start fresh from "start". To ensure continuity, we must prepare the branch with proper documentation and startup files BEFORE resubmission.

### Recovery Process Steps

#### 1. **Identify Expired Agent**
- Agent Name
- Branch
- RequestID
- Status: Expired
- Purpose/Role

#### 2. **Prepare Branch for Recovery**
Before resubmission, update the branch with:

a) **PDCA Documentation**
   - Copy latest `howto.PDCA.md` to branch
   - Copy latest `template.md` to branch
   - Ensure v3.1 compliance

b) **Startup Sequence**
   - Create/update `README.md` with clear startup instructions
   - Include agent's specific role and purpose
   - Reference to agent management tools

c) **Recovery Context**
   - Document why agent expired
   - What work needs to continue
   - Previous achievements if known

d) **Identity Record** (NEW!)
   - Create `/scrum.pmo/agents/registry/[REQUEST-ID].md`
   - Include all identity information
   - Provide clear recovery instructions
   - This is the FIRST place recovered agents look!

#### 3. **Execute Recovery Preparation**
1. Checkout the expired agent's branch
2. Update all necessary files
3. Create identity record
4. Commit changes
5. Push to origin
6. Document in PDCA

#### 4. **Post-Recovery**
After user resubmits:
- Agent starts fresh but knows to check identity record
- Can immediately understand its role
- Has latest PDCA standards
- Can rebuild its tools

### Key Learning
- Expired agents lose their memory/context
- Identity records provide immediate orientation
- Branch preparation enables continuity
- RequestID reuse allows identity preservation
- Proactive documentation prevents knowledge loss

### Success Criteria
- Branch contains latest PDCA standards
- Identity record exists at correct location
- Clear startup instructions present
- Agent purpose documented
- Ready for immediate productivity upon restart
