## **🔧 DO**

**do what you planned with savety protocoll**

**Phase 1: Checklist Analysis and Unknown Terms Identification**

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section:**
```
read_file: scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/cmm3.compliance.checklist.md
# Complete analysis of current checklist for unknown terms and DRY violations
```

**Checklist Analysis Results:**

**Unknown Terms/Processes Requiring Research:**
1. **"TBD" placeholders** - What exactly constitutes TBD vs working dual links?
2. **"git protocol"** - What specific steps constitute the final git protocol?
3. **"§ notation"** - Complete rules beyond basic root path display usage  
4. **Template version 3.1.4.2** - What changed in this specific version?
5. **"QA Decisions"** - What criteria determine if decisions qualify as QA decisions?
6. **"Working dual links"** - What verification process determines if links "work"?

**DRY Violations Identified:**
- **Violation A:** PDCA.dual.link.format.requirement.md linked in 2c AND 3a (duplication)
- **Violation B:** howto.PDCA.md linked in 1g AND 2a (duplication) 
- **Violation C:** PDCA.howto.decide.md linked in 2b AND 5b (duplication)
- **Violation D:** Multiple references to same GitHub branch path pattern (redundant)

**Research Commands Executed:**
```
codebase_search: "What does TBD mean in dual links and what constitutes working versus TBD placeholders?"
codebase_search: "What is the git protocol and what specific steps does it include for PDCA completion?"
codebase_search: "What are QA Decisions and what criteria determine if decisions qualify as QA decisions?"
codebase_search: "What are the complete rules for § notation beyond basic root path display usage?"
codebase_search: "What changed in template version 3.1.4.2 compared to previous versions?"
```

**Phase 2: Research Results Documentation**

**✅ RESEARCH COMPLETED - All Unknown Terms Understood:**

1. **"TBD" placeholders** = "To Be Determined" placeholder content that hasn't been filled in yet
   - Requirement: All links must be working/functional (no TBD placeholders)
   - Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/requiremnents-2025-09-06-UTC-1132-po-dual-linking.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-20/requiremnents-2025-09-06-UTC-1132-po-dual-linking.md](../../../sprints/sprint-20/requiremnents-2025-09-06-UTC-1132-po-dual-linking.md)

2. **"Git protocol"** = Specific mandatory steps for PDCA completion:
   - Immediate commit and push after every PDCA creation
   - One-liner commit messages: `git commit -m "PDCA: [Title from PDCA header]"`
   - Auto-merge to release/dev after every commit
   - Specific branch strategy (save/start → dev/UTC)

3. **"QA Decisions"** = User decisions (not agent decisions) with specific criteria:
   - Present clear options (a/b/c) with rationale and consequences  
   - Copy exactly from PDCA to chat - never create different decisions
   - Use "All clear, no decisions to make" only when PDCA has no pending decisions
   - Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md](../../../_shared/PDCA/PDCA.howto.decide.md)

4. **"§ notation"** = Complete rules for project root path display:
   - § prefix indicates "this path is from project root"
   - In PDCA files: Relative path FROM document TO target
   - In chat responses: Project root paths (chat has NO relative context)
   - Format: `[§/path/from/root](actual/path)`

5. **Template version 3.1.4.2** = Added 42 revelation links integration:
   - Version bump from previous templates  
   - Addition of "The 42 Revelation" section with dual links
   - Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-29-UTC-1230-template-version-update.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-29-UTC-1230-template-version-update.md](../../../../project.journal/2025-08-28-UTC-1154-save-restart-agent/pdca/role/save-restart-agent/2025-08-29-UTC-1230-template-version-update.md)

6. **"Working dual links"** = Links that meet functionality requirements:
   - Functional GitHub URLs (require git push before providing)
   - Working local file paths with correct § notation format
   - Both links on same line separated by ` | `
   - Never use "TBD" placeholders
   - Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md](../../../_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) lines 206-212

**Phase 3: DRY Violation Analysis and Streamlining Strategy**

**✅ DRY VIOLATIONS ANALYSIS COMPLETED:**

**Violation A: PDCA.dual.link.format.requirement.md duplication**
- **Locations:** 2c (Dual link format) AND 3a (GitHub URLs work)
- **Issue:** Same document linked twice for different purposes
- **Solution:** Keep in 2c (primary purpose), reference from 3a with "see 2c"

**Violation B: howto.PDCA.md duplication**  
- **Locations:** 1g (CMM3 violation reporting) AND 2a (Links only, no explanatory text)
- **Issue:** Same document linked for different sections  
- **Solution:** Keep in 2a (primary purpose), reference from 1g with "see 2a"

**Violation C: PDCA.howto.decide.md duplication**
- **Locations:** 2b (QA Decisions copied verbatim) AND 5b (Present decisions when unclear)
- **Issue:** Same document linked for related but distinct purposes
- **Solution:** Keep both (genuinely different use cases), add cross-reference note

**Violation D: GitHub branch path redundancy**
- **Issue:** Multiple identical GitHub branch paths (dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028) 
- **Solution:** Create variable reference system for maintainability

**Streamlining Implementation Plan:**

1. **Create Reference Variables Section** at top of checklist
2. **Consolidate Duplicate Links** using cross-references  
3. **Maintain Information Integrity** - no loss of content
4. **Improve Maintainability** - single source of truth for paths

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section:**
```
read_file: cmm3.compliance.checklist.md (already done)
# Analysis of DRY violations and consolidation strategy development
search_replace: Apply consolidation changes to eliminate redundancies
```

**Streamlining Implementation Executed:**
```
search_replace: Added Reference Documentation section to checklist
search_replace: Consolidated PDCA template reference in 1a
search_replace: Consolidated PDCA Howto references (1g → 2a)
search_replace: Consolidated Dual Link Format references (3a → 2c)
search_replace: Streamlined all references to use centralized documentation
```

**Changes Applied:**
- ✅ **Reference Documentation Section:** Created centralized link repository
- ✅ **Violation A Fixed:** PDCA.dual.link.format.requirement.md now referenced once (2c), 3a references 2c
- ✅ **Violation B Fixed:** howto.PDCA.md now referenced once (2a), 1g references 2a  
- ✅ **Violation C Addressed:** Added cross-reference note between 2b and 5b for related usage
- ✅ **Violation D Fixed:** Eliminated redundant GitHub branch path duplications

**DRY Compliance Achieved:** All information maintained, redundancy eliminated, maintainability improved
