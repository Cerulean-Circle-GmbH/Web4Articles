**🚨 Issues:** Agent missed critical dev branch creation until prompted  
**📎 Previous Commit:** d340197 - Update: Complete start documentation with decision philosophy and git automation  
**🔗 Previous PDCA:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/save/start/temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0845-update-start-documentation-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0845-update-start-documentation-pdca.md](temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0845-update-start-documentation-pdca.md)

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/save/start/temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0900-cmm4-test-feedback-analysis-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0900-cmm4-test-feedback-analysis-pdca.md](temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0900-cmm4-test-feedback-analysis-pdca.md)

### **QA Decisions**
- [x] **Decision 1: Branch Creation Timing**
  - a) Create dev branch immediately after "start" ✅
  - b) Keep it at session end only

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-0855)**

here is what happened. read it and pdca:

I'll help you get started! Let me first explore the workspace to understand what we're working with.

Listed 23 items in current directory

Now let me check the README to understand what this project is about:

Read README.md

I can see this is a Web4Articles DAPP project, and I'm operating as a Background Agent. Let me follow the instructions in the README:

Ran: ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md

Good, the PDCA setup exists. Now let me read the recovery guide as instructed:

Read start-command.md

Now let me check the current branch:

Ran: git branch --show-current

I need to switch to the save/start branch as instructed:

Ran: git checkout save/start

Now let me install the git automation hook as instructed:

Ran 2 terminal commands

Now let me create a todo list to track my tasks:

Updated todo list

Let me check for any recent commits or work to understand the current state:

Ran: git log --oneline -10

Let me check for any uncommitted changes:

Ran: git status

Let me check if there are any open issues or recent pull requests:

Listed 4 items in current directory

Let me check the recent project journal to understand current activities:

Listed 48 items in current directory

Let me check the most recent sprint:

Listed 24 items in current directory

Now let me create a PDCA for this startup procedure:

Updated todo list

Now let me commit and push the PDCA:

Ran terminal command and updated todo list

PDCA Entry: GitHub | scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-23-startup-procedure/pdca-startup.md

QA Decisions
All clear, no decisions to make - Startup procedure is straightforward with clear documentation and no risky operations

did you create a new branch dev/[utc timestamp] at the end and switched to it to continue your session? if not, add this crucial element in save/start documentation for yourself (the background agent 🕵️‍♂️ ) and do it then. pdca

You're absolutely right! I missed that crucial step. Let me update the documentation and then create the timestamped branch.

Updated todo list

Let me first read the recovery start-command.md to see where to add this:

Replaced text

Now let me also add a clearer note at the beginning:

Replaced text

Now let me create the timestamped branch:

Ran 2 terminal commands and updated todo list

Now let me create a PDCA for this important correction:

Now let me commit and push these changes:

Ran terminal command and updated todo list

PDCA Entry: GitHub | scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-24-branch-correction/pdca-branch-correction.md

QA Decisions
All clear, no decisions to make - Correction completed successfully. Now operating on dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0857 branch as required.
```

### **My Answer**
The test revealed a critical gap: the agent correctly followed most procedures but MISSED creating the dev/UTC branch until you explicitly reminded them. This needs immediate fixing in documentation.

**Learning Applied:** Clear instructions aren't enough - need proper sequencing and emphasis.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Test Results Analysis:**
1. What worked well
2. What failed
3. Why it failed
4. How to fix

**Documentation Improvements:**
- Move branch creation earlier
- Make it unmissable
- Add to checklist
- Emphasize importance

---

## **🔧 DO** 

**What Worked Well:**
✅ Agent identified as Background Agent
✅ Switched to save/start branch
✅ Installed git hook correctly
✅ Created todos
✅ Made PDCA correctly
✅ Used proper format
✅ Said "All clear" appropriately

**What Failed:**
❌ Did NOT create dev/UTC branch
❌ Stayed on save/start for work
❌ Only fixed when prompted

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Branch creation is at END of checklist
2. Easy to miss or forget
3. Not emphasized enough
4. Contradicts "stay on save/start"

**The Problem:**
Documentation says both:
- "ALWAYS work on save/start"
- "Create dev/UTC at session end"

Agent followed first rule, missed second!

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**CMM4 Test Validation:**

**Success Rate: 90%**
- 9/10 procedures followed
- 1 critical miss: dev branch

**Agent Understanding:**
- Good: PDCA format
- Good: Decision philosophy
- Good: Git automation
- Bad: Branch timing

**Documentation Issue:**
Current structure buries branch creation at step 10 of recovery checklist. Agent completed work before reaching it!

**TRON QA Feedback Validation**
> **"did you create a new branch dev/[utc timestamp] at the end and switched to it to continue your session?"**

**Answer:** NO - Agent missed this completely until reminded.

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Required Documentation Fix:**
1. Move dev branch creation IMMEDIATELY after start
2. Clarify workflow sequence
3. Make it impossible to miss

**New Sequence:**
1. Start → Switch to save/start
2. Immediately create dev/UTC branch
3. Do all work on dev/UTC
4. PDCAs auto-merge from there too

**Update Needed:**
- Revise start-command.md
- Change branch strategy
- Fix contradictory instructions
- Test again

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Testing Insights**

### **Surprise Factor:**
**HIGH** - Documentation seemed complete but had fatal flaw.

### **Learning Value:**
**CRITICAL** - CMM4 testing revealed hidden issues.

### **Improvement Clarity:**
**STRONG** - Know exactly what to fix.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **CMM4 Testing:** Essential for finding gaps
- ✅ **Sequence Matters:** Order of instructions critical
- ✅ **Contradiction Danger:** Mixed messages confuse agents
- ✅ **Early Branch Creation:** Better than end-of-session

**Quality Impact:** Agent mostly succeeded but missed critical branch management.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Fix documentation with proper branch creation timing.
