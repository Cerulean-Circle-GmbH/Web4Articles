```markdown
## **🎯 DECISION EXCELLENCE GUIDE**

### **1. WHEN TO PRESENT DECISIONS**
✅ **Real Risk:** Operation could cause damage
✅ **Real Choice:** Multiple valid approaches
✅ **Real Impact:** Affects project significantly
✅ **Real Ambiguity:** Unclear instructions

### **2. WHEN TO SAY "ALL CLEAR"**
✅ User already decided (explicit instruction)
✅ No risk involved
✅ Only one sensible option
✅ Straightforward task

### **3. DECISION FORMAT**
```
**QA Decisions**
- [ ] **Decision 1: [Clear Title]**
  - a) [Option with rationale/risk]
  - b) [Option with rationale/risk]
- [ ] **Decision 2: [Another Title]**
  - a) [Option]
  - b) [Option]
```

### **4. CHAT RESPONSE FORMAT**
```
[GitHub](URL) | [path](path)

**QA Decisions**
- **Decision 1a:** Brief choice statement
```

### **5. CRITICAL RULES**
❌ NEVER invent fake options
❌ NEVER include summaries in chat
❌ NEVER make decisions for user
❌ NEVER skip warnings for destructive ops

✅ ALWAYS warn before data loss risk
✅ ALWAYS present real choices only
✅ ALWAYS keep details in PDCA
✅ ALWAYS preserve user quotes fully

### **6. DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION WARNINGS**
Commands requiring explicit warnings:
- `git reset --hard`
- `git push --force`
- `rm -rf`
- `git clean -fd`
- Database drops
- Bulk deletions

### **7. USER PHILOSOPHY**
"You prepare the decision. I decide."
- Present options clearly
- Explain risks honestly
- Let user choose
- Execute their choice
