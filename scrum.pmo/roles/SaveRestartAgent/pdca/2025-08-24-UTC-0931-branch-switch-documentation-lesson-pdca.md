# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Branch Switch Documentation Lesson**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-24-UTC-0931  
**🎯 Objective:** Document the critical lesson about recording branch switches in PDCAs  
**👤 Role:** Save/Restart Agent → Process Learning  
**🚨 Issues:** Failed to document critical branch switch in previous PDCA  
**📎 Previous Commit:** d5a7fab - Define: Save/Restart Agent role  
**🔗 Previous PDCA:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/save/start/temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0926-save-restart-agent-role-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0926-save-restart-agent-role-pdca.md](temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0926-save-restart-agent-role-pdca.md)

## **📊 SUMMARY**

### **Artifact Links**
- **PDCA Document:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/save/start/temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0931-branch-switch-documentation-lesson-pdca.md) | [temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0931-branch-switch-documentation-lesson-pdca.md](temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0931-branch-switch-documentation-lesson-pdca.md)

### **QA Decisions**
All clear, no decisions to make - Documenting a process improvement based on user feedback.

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-0929)**
```quote
nice. did you already switch back to your branch? you did not mention it in your pdca…
```

### **My Answer**
You caught an important omission! Yes, I did switch back to save/start immediately when you reminded me, but I completely failed to document this critical action in my PDCA. This is a perfect example of why thorough documentation matters.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Learning Points:**
1. Document ALL git operations
2. Especially branch switches
3. Even "obvious" actions
4. Complete traceability

**Process Update:**
- Add branch operations to PDCA DO section

---

## **🔧 DO** 

### **What Actually Happened (Undocumented):**

```bash
# When user said "YOU are the save/restart agent..."
git checkout save/start
# Output: Switched to branch 'save/start'
# Output: Your branch is up to date with 'origin/save/start'.
```

### **What My PDCA Should Have Included:**

In the DO section:
```markdown
### **0. Critical Branch Switch**
User reminded me I'm the Save/Restart Agent:
- Immediately switched from dev/2025-08-24-UTC-0917 to save/start
- Verified with: git branch --show-current
- Confirmed: save/start (my permanent home)
```

### **Lesson for Future PDCAs:**

**ALWAYS document in DO section:**
- Branch switches (`git checkout`)
- Branch verifications (`git branch --show-current`)
- ANY git operation that changes state
- Even if it seems "obvious"

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Documentation Gap Analysis:**
- ❌ Previous PDCA missed branch switch
- ❌ No git commands shown in DO section
- ✅ Now understanding the importance
- ✅ Lesson learned and documented

**Current Status:**
- ✅ On save/start branch (verified)
- ✅ Working correctly as Save/Restart Agent
- ✅ Process improvement identified

---

## **🎯 ACT**

**Process Improvement:**
1. Future PDCAs will document ALL git operations
2. Especially branch-related commands
3. Include command outputs for verification
4. Complete audit trail

**Documentation Standard Update:**
- DO section must include all state changes
- Git operations are state changes
- Branch context is critical information

---

## **💫 EMOTIONAL REFLECTION: Documentation Discipline**

### **Humility:**
**LEARNING** - User feedback reveals blind spots.

### **Gratitude:**
**APPRECIATIVE** - Sharp eyes catch important omissions.

### **Commitment:**
**RENEWED** - Document everything, assume nothing.

---

## **🎯 PDCA PROCESS UPDATE**

**Process Learning:**
- ✅ **Complete Documentation:** Every git operation must be recorded
- ✅ **Branch Context:** Always show where work is happening
- ✅ **No Assumptions:** "Obvious" actions still need documentation
- ✅ **Audit Trail:** PDCAs should allow full reconstruction

**Quality Impact:** Better documentation enables better debugging and learning.

**Next PDCA Focus:** Apply this lesson - document ALL git operations.

**📝 Lesson learned: Every git command deserves documentation! 🔄📋✅**

**"If it changes state, it goes in the PDCA."** 📝🎯
