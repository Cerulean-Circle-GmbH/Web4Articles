## **📋 PLAN**

**Primary Objective:** Research safety protocol meaning and enhance CMM3 checklist with research requirements

**Expected Output:**
1. **Protocol Understanding:** Clear definition of what "savety protocoll" means in Web4Articles context
2. **Research Documentation:** Comprehensive research findings with dual links to sources  
3. **Enhanced CMM3 Checklist:** Added research requirements to prevent future understanding violations
4. **Compliance Restoration:** Acknowledgment of CMM3 violation and systematic correction approach

**CMM3 Violation Acknowledgment:**
- ✅ **Admitted:** Used "savety protocoll" without understanding meaning
- ✅ **Identified:** CMM3 requires research first or asking if research fails  
- ✅ **Committed:** Will research systematically and enhance compliance checklist

**Research Strategy:**
1. Search codebase for "safety" and "protocol" references
2. Search for existing safety documentation in project
3. Search for agent safety protocols and howto documents
4. If no findings, prepare questions for TRON clarification

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Phase 1: Safety Protocol Research (Steps 3-4)**

```
codebase_search: "What are the safety protocols for agent operations and command execution?"
grep: "safety.*protocol"
glob_file_search: "*safety*"
read_file: scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto-agent-safety-protocols.md
```

**Research Results Found:**
- ✅ **Primary Document:** `howto-agent-safety-protocols.md` - Comprehensive agent safety protocols
- ✅ **16 Safety Files:** Multiple safety protocol documents across project journals  
- ✅ **701 References:** Extensive safety protocol usage throughout codebase
- ✅ **Shell Isolation Breakthrough:** 99%+ effective method for process safety

**Safety Protocol Definition Found:**

**"Savety Protocoll" = Agent Safety Protocols for Background Operations:**
1. **Shell Isolation Strategy:** `bash -c "command"` for automatic process cleanup (99%+ effective)
2. **Core File Prevention:** Check and prevent large system crash dump files from being committed
3. **Non-Interactive Commands:** Use `--no-edit`, `--no-commit` flags to prevent terminal hangs
4. **Process Monitoring:** Track defunct processes and repository size
5. **Emergency Procedures:** Systematic recovery for hanging operations and large file issues

**Key Safety Components:**
- ✅ **Shell Isolation:** `bash -c "git command"` - Breakthrough method with automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Interactive Prevention:** Never use commands that require user input (background agents can't respond)
- ✅ **Core File Detection:** `find . -name "core" -type f` before any git operations
- ✅ **Gitignore Verification:** Ensure core files are ignored
- ✅ **Timeout Fallback:** Legacy `timeout 30s command` if shell isolation unavailable

**Critical Safety Violations I Made:**
- ❌ **Used "savety protocoll" without understanding what it meant**
- ❌ **CMM3 Compliance Violation:** Failed to research before implementing
- ❌ **Process Understanding:** Preserved exact wording but ignored meaning

**Research Findings Documentation:**

**Phase 2: CMM3 Checklist Enhancement (Steps 3-4)**

**Command Executed:**
```
search_replace on cmm3.compliance.checklist.md
Added 1h: Understanding research requirement with detailed specification
```

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced CMM3 checklist with research requirement
- Added understanding verification step to prevent future violations
- Specified: "Research unknown terms/processes before use or ask TRON if research fails"

---

## **✅ CHECK**

**Step 5: Verification Planning - Commands to Execute**

**Commands to verify expected output:**
```
grep -A 3 "1h" scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/cmm3.compliance.checklist.md
