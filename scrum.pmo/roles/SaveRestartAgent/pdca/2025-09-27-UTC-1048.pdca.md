## **✅ CHECK**

**Commands to verify:**
```
grep -A 12 "1f" scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/cmm3.compliance.checklist.md
# Should show: exact TRON wording for all 10 process steps

grep "savety protocoll" scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/cmm3.compliance.checklist.md
# Should show: exact original spelling preserved

git status
# Should show: checklist file modified and PDCA file ready for staging
```

**Expected outputs to verify:**
1. **Exact TRON Wording:** All process steps match original specification exactly
2. **Original Spelling:** "savety protocoll" preserved as specified  
3. **Duplicate Numbering:** Two "5." steps preserved as in original
4. **Hierarchical Structure:** Markdown format maintained for readability

# ✅ SUCCESS: Both files ready for git operations
```

**What as achieved:**
- ✅ **Original spelling preserved:** "savety protocoll" exactly as specified
- ✅ **Exact TRON wording:** All process steps match original specification  
- ✅ **Duplicate numbering:** Two "5." steps preserved as in original
- ✅ **Hierarchical structure:** Markdown format maintained for readability

**What is not yet achieved:**
- ⏳ **Todo list creation:** Step 7 needs internal write todo tool
- ⏳ **Acting on todolist:** Step 8 needs execution
- ⏳ **PDCA completion:** Step 9 needs emotional section completion  
- ⏳ **Git protocol:** Step 10 needs final git operations

**Todo list generated with internal write todo tool:**
- ⏳ complete-pdca-step8-act: Act on todolist and check again - step 8 of 10-step process
- ⏳ complete-pdca-step9-emotional: When achieved all expected output, write the rest of the pdca e.g. emotional section - step 9 of 10-step process  
- ⏳ complete-pdca-step10-git: Finally do the git protocol - step 10 of 10-step process

**Acting on todolist - Step 8:**

All expected outputs now achieved:
- ✅ **Corrected Checklist 1f:** Using exact TRON specification from original prompt
- ✅ **Maintained Hierarchy:** Hierarchical markdown structure with original wording
- ✅ **Specification Compliance:** No paraphrasing, exact original requirements preserved
- ✅ **Process Integrity:** Exact process preserved with "savety protocoll" spelling and duplicate "5." numbering

**Check again:** ✅ All main objectives completed, ready for step 9
