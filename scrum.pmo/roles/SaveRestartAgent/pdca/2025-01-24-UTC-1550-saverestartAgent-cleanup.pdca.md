pdca

somehow you crashed. can you recover?
```

### **My Answer**
Recovered successfully. Applied same git mv approach to organize my own SaveRestartAgent PDCAs:

1. **Moved temp files** - All 2025-08-23 and 2025-08-24 SaveRestartAgent PDCAs from temp/ 
2. **Preserved history** - Used git mv to maintain file tracking
3. **Proper location** - Organized in scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca/
4. **Crash recovery** - Checked status and completed cleanup

**Learning Applied:** Consistency - organize own files with same standards applied to others.
