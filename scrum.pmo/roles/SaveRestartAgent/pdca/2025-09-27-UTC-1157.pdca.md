- **Post Mortem Rewrite:** Complete UTC-1128 PDCA rewrite with all planned accomplishments

### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Post mortem analysis and PDCA completion issue resolution per TRON instruction

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1157)**
```quote
scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca/2025-09-27-UTC-1128.pdca.md is still broken.
pdca about why you had problems and how to prevent them. finally rewrite this whole broken pdca in one go as a post mortem documentation, ass all plannes where accomplished. then finish your pdca for this prompt.
```

### **My Answer**
Acknowledged - UTC-1128 PDCA is incomplete/broken despite multiple completion attempts. Will analyze root causes of file completion issues, create prevention measures, and rewrite UTC-1128 as complete post mortem documentation assuming all planned systematic fixes were accomplished.

**Learning Applied:** PDCA file integrity and completion must be verified before reporting complete - partial updates lead to broken documentation

---

## **üìã PLAN**

**Primary Objective:** Analyze PDCA completion failures, rewrite UTC-1128 as post mortem, establish prevention measures

**Requirements Traceability:** PDCA Template 3.1.4.2 compliance and file integrity for web4 component cooperation

**Intense use of tracking tables for artifacts and task lists:**

### **üìä PDCA COMPLETION ISSUE ANALYSIS TRACKING TABLE**

| Issue Type | Root Cause | Impact | Prevention Measure |
|------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Partial File Updates** | search_replace timeout on large files | Incomplete sections | Use write tool for complete rewrites |
| **Template Violations** | Incremental updates missing sections | CMM2/1 violations | Complete file verification after updates |
| **Content Inconsistency** | Multiple edit attempts fragmenting content | Broken PDCA structure | Single complete rewrite approach |
| **Verification Gaps** | No final file read verification | Undetected completion failures | Mandatory read_file verification step |

### **üìã UTC-1128 POST MORTEM REWRITE TRACKING TABLE**

| Original Planned Task | Accomplishment Status | Post Mortem Documentation |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Systematic PDCA Analysis** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | All Template 3.1.4.2 violations identified across session PDCAs |
| **Cascade Fixes Applied** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | UTC-1055 and UTC-1103 systematically repaired with tracking tables |
| **CMM3 Checklist Enhancement** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | Items 1f, 1fh, 1i updated with todo/tracking requirements |
| **Web4 Component Cooperation** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | All session PDCAs CMM3 compliant for sessionSummary program |
| **Progress Tracking Methodology** | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | Enhanced tracking tables with real-time progress updates |
| **PDCA Completion Standards** | ‚ùå FAILED | File completion integrity issues prevent proper documentation |

**Expected Output:**
- ‚úÖ **Issue Analysis:** Complete root cause analysis of PDCA completion problems with prevention measures
- ‚úÖ **UTC-1128 Post Mortem:** Complete rewrite assuming all systematic PDCA fixes accomplished successfully
- ‚úÖ **Prevention Framework:** Systematic approach to prevent future PDCA file completion issues
- ‚úÖ **Template Compliance:** Full Template 3.1.4.2 compliance for both analysis and post mortem documentation
- ‚úÖ **Web4 Component Cooperation:** Ensure all PDCAs maintain CMM3 compliance for sessionSummary program

**Safety Protocol:** Interrupt immediately for unexpected observations or ambiguities and ask TRON. After answer continue.

## **üîß DO**

**do what you planned with savety protocoll**

**Phase 1: PDCA Completion Issue Analysis (Steps 3-4)**

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis of UTC-1128 PDCA Issues
read_file UTC-1128: Identified incomplete file with only 115 lines vs expected complete PDCA structure

# Analysis Results:
# - File shows only partial content (115 lines) 
# - Missing CHECK section completion with tracking tables
# - Missing ACT, emotional reflection, process update sections
# - search_replace timeout errors during large file updates
# - Incremental update approach caused fragmentation
```

**Phase 2: Prevention Measures Documentation**

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Large File Update Timeouts:** search_replace tool times out on extensive content additions
2. **Incremental Update Fragmentation:** Multiple partial updates cause content inconsistency  
3. **No Final Verification:** Missing mandatory file read after completion claims
4. **Template Section Gaps:** Incomplete sections not detected during incremental updates

**Prevention Framework:**
- **Complete Rewrite Approach:** Use write tool for complete PDCA rewrites instead of incremental updates
- **Mandatory Verification:** Always read_file after completion claims to verify content integrity
- **Single-Pass Completion:** Complete all sections in one operation rather than incremental additions
- **Template Checklist:** Verify all 6 mandatory Template 3.1.4.2 sections present before claiming completion

**Phase 3: UTC-1128 Complete Post Mortem Rewrite**

**Assumption:** All planned systematic PDCA fixes were accomplished successfully
```bash
# Creating complete UTC-1128 post mortem assuming successful completion
write UTC-1128-postmortem: Complete PDCA with all sections and tracking tables
# Documenting successful systematic PDCA compliance restoration
# All Template 3.1.4.2 violations fixed across session PDCAs  
# Web4 component cooperation enabled through CMM3 compliance
```

---

## **‚úÖ CHECK**

**write how you will check it in the check section and what outputs you need to verify how with command quotes**

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Verify UTC-1128 post mortem completeness
read_file scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca/2025-09-27-UTC-1128-postmortem.pdca.md
# Should show: Complete PDCA with all 6 Template 3.1.4.2 sections

# Verify current PDCA completeness
read_file scrum.pmo/roles/SaveRestartAgent/pdca/2025-09-27-UTC-1157.pdca.md
# Should show: All sections completed per template requirements

# Check git status for commit readiness
git status
# Should show: Both PDCAs ready for staging and commit
```

**check if you achieved the expected output:**
