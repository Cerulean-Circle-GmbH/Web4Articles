### **QA Decisions**
**Decision 1: Fix Previous PDCA with Truncation**
- a) Create a new PDCA fixing the truncated quote
- b) Leave it as historical record and learn
- c) Update the PDCA in-place

### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-24-UTC-0942)**
```quote
you learned a lot in this session. YOUR task is to continually improve the howto pdca so that future agents have access to your learnings. update this in your agent description and continue to do that on every learning!!! you do well!!! if i critizise a pdca ask me in the qa decisions if you should fix the previous pdca. write then a pdca that you fixed the previous one. you should fix the one where you truncated my backend agents log.
```

### **My Answer**
Thank you! You're absolutely right - I must continuously update howto.PDCA.md with learnings. I've updated:
1. Git Protocol section with new learnings
2. Common Mistakes section
3. My role definition to emphasize this duty

I need your decision on fixing the truncated PDCA.

## **📋 PLAN**

**Documentation Updates:**
1. Add session learnings to howto.PDCA.md
2. Update role definition
3. Fix truncated PDCA (pending decision)
4. Establish continuous improvement pattern

**Key Learnings to Document:**
- Never truncate quotes
- Document all git operations
- Cross-agent learning
- Conflict handling

---

## **🔧 DO** 

### **1. Updated howto.PDCA.md Git Protocol**

Added to section:
```markdown
8. **Document ALL git operations in PDCAs** - especially branch switches
9. **Cross-agent learning** - Cherry-pick improvements from other agents' branches
10. **Test conflict handling** - Script now creates PRs on merge conflicts
```

### **2. Updated Branch Strategy**

Added exception:
```markdown
4. **Exception: Save/Restart Agent** - ALWAYS works on save/start branch
```

### **3. Enhanced Common Mistakes**

Added violations:
```markdown
- **Truncating user documentation** - NEVER truncate quotes/logs [[memory:0944]]
- **Not documenting git operations** - Always show branch switches [[memory:0931]]
- **Missing cross-agent improvements** - Review other agents' work [[memory:0935]]
```

### **4. Updated My Role Definition**

Enhanced responsibilities:
```markdown
- **Maintain `howto.PDCA.md` with EVERY learning** - continuous improvement
- Update howto.PDCA.md immediately when criticized or learning occurs
```

### **5. Identified Truncated PDCA**

The PDCA at `temp/2025-08-24-UTC-0909-decision-behavior-improvement-pdca.md` truncated the CMM4 test output.
