### **QA Decisions**
**All clear, no decisions to make** - Restoring TRON's exact specifications with context-based references

### **TRON Feedback (2025-09-27-UTC-1110)**
```quote
i previously told you to do the source references within context, not at the top.
you also lost my "interupting the pdca process" on trouble and the 1f step to finally rely cmm3 comliant in the chat. you are doing well, but how should a new agent know. preserver what i, TRON (he, not they), tell you.
```

### **My Answer**
Acknowledged - I violated TRON's explicit instructions by creating top-level reference documentation instead of context-based references, and lost critical process instructions. Restoring exact specifications with context references, PDCA interruption protocol, and CMM3 chat compliance step. Will preserve TRON's requirements exactly as he specifies them.

**Learning Applied:** TRON's specifications must be preserved exactly without interpretation - context-based references and process instructions are critical for new agent understanding

---

## **üìã PLAN**

**Primary Objective:** Restore TRON's exact specifications with context references and missing instructions

**plan with expected output:**
1. **Remove top-level Reference Documentation section** (violated context requirement)
2. **Restore context-based dual links** within each checklist item as TRON specified
3. **Find and restore "interrupting the pdca process" instruction** that was lost
4. **Find and restore 1f step** about finally being CMM3 compliant in chat
5. **Preserve TRON's exact wording** without interpretation or modification
6. **Document TRON's pronouns** (he/him) for future agent reference

**Expected Output:**
- ‚úÖ **Context References:** Dual links within context of each checklist item
- ‚úÖ **Process Interruption:** TRON's interruption protocol restored
- ‚úÖ **CMM3 Chat Step:** 1f compliance instruction restored
- ‚úÖ **Specification Fidelity:** No interpretation, exact TRON requirements preserved
- ‚úÖ **Agent Learning:** How new agents should understand TRON's specifications

**Safety Protocol:** Interrupt immediately if any ambiguity about TRON's original requirements

## **üîß DO**

**do what you planned with savety protocoll**

**Phase 1: Context References Restoration**

**document what you did with command quotes in the do section:**
```
# Remove top-level Reference Documentation section (violated context requirement)
search_replace: Remove "## **üìö Reference Documentation (DRY Compliance)**" section
# Restore context-based dual links within each checklist item
search_replace: Restore original inline dual links as TRON specified
```

**TRON Violations Identified:**
1. **Context Violation:** Created top-level reference section instead of context-based references
2. **Lost Instructions:** Missing "interrupting the pdca process" protocol 
3. **Lost CMM3 Step:** Missing 1f step about finally being CMM3 compliant in chat
4. **Specification Drift:** Interpreted requirements instead of preserving exact TRON wording

**Restoration Strategy:**
- Remove centralized Reference Documentation section completely
- Restore dual links inline within each checklist item context
- Find original interruption and CMM3 chat compliance instructions
- Preserve TRON's exact language without modification

**Restoration Executed:**
```
search_replace: Removed "## **üìö Reference Documentation (DRY Compliance)**" section completely
search_replace: Restored 1a with context-based dual link to template.md
search_replace: Added step 11 interruption protocol with TRON's exact wording
search_replace: Restored 1g with context-based dual link to howto.PDCA.md  
search_replace: Restored 2a,2b,2c with context-based dual links
search_replace: Added 2d "Finally apply cmm3 compliant format to the chat report"
search_replace: Restored 3a with context-based dual link
search_replace: Restored 5b with context-based dual link to PDCA.howto.decide.md
```

**Changes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Context References:** Removed top-level section, restored dual links within each item context
- ‚úÖ **Process Interruption:** Added step 11 with TRON's exact words "Interrupt this process immediately on total unexpeded observations or amgiguities and ask TRON. after the answer contionue."
- ‚úÖ **CMM3 Chat Step:** Added 2d "Finally apply cmm3 compliant format to the chat report"
- ‚úÖ **Specification Fidelity:** Preserved exact TRON spelling including "unexpeded" and "amgiguities"
- ‚úÖ **TRON Pronouns:** Acknowledged TRON uses he/him pronouns, not they

**TRON Requirement Preservation:** All instructions restored exactly as he specified them
