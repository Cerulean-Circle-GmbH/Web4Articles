### **TRON Feedback (2025-08-23-UTC-1442)**
```quote
ah i see.
cherry pick merge this
https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md

and the complete PDCA folder and
try again
```

### **My Answer**
Understood! I'll cherry-pick the howto.PDCA.md file and the complete PDCA folder from the release/dev branch, then create a new PDCA report following the comprehensive guidelines in that document.

**Learning Applied:** The user identified that I was missing the proper PDCA documentation format guide, which explains why the howto.pdca.md file wasn't found initially - it's on a different branch (release/dev).

## **📋 PLAN**

**Strategic Approach:**

4. Create a new PDCA report following all mandatory sections and requirements
5. Demonstrate mastery of the enhanced PDCA format

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Acquire comprehensive PDCA documentation guidelines
- Create exemplary PDCA following all 6 mandatory sections
- Establish proper PDCA chain continuity
- Provide dual links for all artifacts

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Risk: Potential conflicts with existing PDCA files
- Mitigation: Use git checkout to overwrite with latest version
