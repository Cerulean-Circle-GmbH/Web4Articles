```

### **My Answer**
Cherry-picking _shared folder from release/dev and analyzing the updates.

**Learning Applied:** Change request process enables collaborative improvement across agents.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Objective:** Synchronize _shared folder with release/dev to capture latest improvements

**Requirements Traceability:** N/A - Process maintenance task

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Fetch & Cherry-pick:** Get latest _shared folder from release/dev
- **Analyze Changes:** Review new files and modifications
- **Document Findings:** Create comprehensive analysis of updates

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Implementation Actions**

**1. Cherry-picked _shared Folder**
```bash
git fetch origin release/dev
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/
# Overwrote our version as requested
```

**2. Key Updates Found**

**New Additions:**
1. **external-references/** - New folder with symlinks to key documents
2. **change.requests/** - Three new improvement proposals from Background Agent
3. **PDCA requirement symlinks** - Links to spec requirements

**Updated Files:**
- `howto.PDCA.md` - Now version 2.5 (consolidated guidelines)
- `template.md` - Enhanced with more placeholders

**3. Change Request Analysis**

**From Background Agent 🕵️‍♂️:**

**a) CMM Learning Journey (High Priority)**
- Proposes adding "Why Compliance Matters" section
- Shows progression from CMM 2 (chaos) to CMM 4 (managed)
- Real examples of failed "improvements"
- Key lesson: "The template you resist often contains the beauty you seek"

**b) Safe Additive-Only Workflow (High Priority)**
- CRITICAL: Replace force-push with safe merges
- Incident: 819 commits lost from release/dev
- New rule: Compare timestamps, only add newer files
- Never use --force or --force-with-lease

**c) Template Enhancement (High Priority)**
- Transform basic template into style guide
- Add emoji reference guide
- Include emotional reflection section
- Writing style tips for personality

**4. External References Structure**

**New symlinks provide quick access to:**
- `pdca-howto-guide.md` → howto.PDCA.md
- `project-readme.md` → Root README
- `web4-requirements-paradigm-shifts.md` → Sprint 20 doc
- `ucp-component-definition.md` → UCP architecture
