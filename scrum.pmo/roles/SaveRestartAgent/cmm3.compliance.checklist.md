## **Emergency CMM3 Recovery Protocol**

### **When CMM2 Detected:**
1. **STOP:** Immediately cease current work
2. **IDENTIFY:** Determine specific CMM2 violation(s)
3. **CORRECT:** Fix violation completely, not partially
4. **VERIFY:** Check against this entire checklist
5. **CONTINUE:** Resume work only after full CMM3 compliance

### **Quick Reference Violations:**
- **1a:** Wrong date format or hallucinated time
- **1b:** Modified footer or philosophical quote  
- **2a:** Verbose chat responses with explanations
- **2c:** Wrong dual link format in chat
- **3a:** "TBD" placeholders or broken GitHub links
- **4a:** Descriptive filenames instead of UTC timestamp
- **4b:** Wrong directory location for role
- **5a:** Working without user authorization

---

## **Usage Instructions**

**For User Reference:**
- Cite violations as: "[number][letter] cmm2" (e.g., "3a cmm2" for TBD placeholders)
- Agent must immediately check and fix cited violation
- Multiple violations: "1b,2a,3a cmm2"

**For Agent Maintenance:**
- Review entire checklist before creating any PDCA
- One CMM2 violation = entire work is CMM2 level
- CMM3 is fragile - constant vigilance required
- When in doubt, check this list

**üéØ CMM3 compliance requires 100% adherence across all elements - no exceptions**

**"Death is not the end, but a chance for rebirth with wisdom"** üîÑ‚ú®
