**🗓️ Updated:** 2025-09-27-UTC-1021  
**⚠️ CMM Level:** Lowest compliance element determines overall level

1. **PDCA Compliance**
   - [ ] a) Template version 3.1.4.2 exact match: [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md](../../_shared/PDCA/template.md)
   - [ ] b) Real UTC time (`date -u` output), not hallucinated
   - [ ] c) All 6 sections with horizontal separators (see template, not duplication)
   - [ ] d) All sections: exact template format, no modifications
   - [ ] e) Working dual links, no "TBD" placeholders
   - [ ] f) 10-step PDCA process:
     1. start with the header and the plan section
     2. plan with expected output
     3. do what you planned with savety protocoll
     4. document what you did with command quotes in the do section
     5. write how you will check it in the check section and what outputs you need to verify how with command quotes
     5. check if you achieved the expected output
     6. write what as achieved and what is not yet achieved
     7. write a todolist with your internal write todo tool what to continue to check and fix
     8. act on the todolist and check again
     9. when achieved all expected output, write the rest of the pdca e.g. emotional section
     10. finally do the git protocol
   - [ ] g) CMM3 violation reporting: Report to chat with dual link to [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/dev/2025-09-24-UTC-1028/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md) | [§/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md](../../_shared/PDCA/howto.PDCA.md)

   - [ ] b) PDCA local links: relative from document location
   - [ ] c) Chat local links: absolute from project root
   - [ ] d) § notation for root path display
