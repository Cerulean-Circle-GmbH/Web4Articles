# PDCA Entry - Major Journal Cleanup: Linking Diaries to PDCAs

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Read all PDCAs from journal entries (2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev onwards)
  - Link diary entries to original PDCAs where experiences occurred
  - Add missing SHA metadata and previous PDCA links in double format
  - Ensure full traceability across journal entries
- **Scope:** 
  - 6 journal directories with 70+ PDCA entries
  - 5 diary entries to be linked
  - Enhanced metadata addition to all PDCAs
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - 100% of PDCAs have traceability metadata
  - All diary entries properly linked to source PDCAs
  - SHA references added where missing
  - Previous PDCA chains established
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev/
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-2030-test-matrix-v3/
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-18-0833-recovery/
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-0800-fresh-dawn/
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-1100-tsranger-v21-sprint/
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-20-0630-tsranger-v22-sprint/
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Each PDCA has PDCA TRACEABILITY METADATA section
  - Diary entries reference source PDCAs with links
  - Previous PDCA chains are traceable
  - Git commit SHAs documented
- **Assumptions:**
  - PDCAs follow standard format
  - Diary entries describe real experiences from PDCAs
  - Git history is available for SHA references
- **Constraints:**
  - Large number of files to update
  - Need to maintain consistency
  - Must preserve existing content
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Manual update each file (selected)
    - Pros: Precise control, can verify content
    - Cons: Time-consuming
  - Option 2: Automated script
    - Pros: Fast
    - Cons: Risk of incorrect updates
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Manual updates ensure accuracy and proper linking
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Missing connections between diary and PDCAs
  - Mitigation: Read content carefully to identify relationships

## Do
- Actions executed:
  1. Discovered 70+ PDCA entries across 6 journal directories
  2. Found 5 diary entries needing linkage:
     - 2025-08-18-0833-recovery/diary.entry.md
     - 2025-08-19-0800-fresh-dawn/pdca/role/po/2025-08-19-UTC-1005-task-creation-execution-diary.md
     - 2025-08-19-0800-fresh-dawn/pdca/role/scrummaster/2025-08-19-UTC-1000-multi-agent-coordination-mastery-diary.md
     - 2025-08-19-1100-tsranger-v21-sprint/developer-diary-unguided-v21-sprint.md
     - 2025-08-20-0630-tsranger-v22-sprint/diary (directory)
  3. Identified that journal PDCAs lack enhanced traceability metadata
  4. Creating systematic update plan
- Artifacts to be changed:
  - All PDCA entries in journal directories - Add traceability metadata
  - Diary entries - Add links to source PDCAs
- Commands run:
```bash
# Find journal entries from sprint 5 onwards
ls -1 /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/ | grep "^2025-08-" | sort | awk '/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev/,0'

# Find diary entries
find /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev [...] -name "*diary*" -o -name "*experience*" | sort

# Find all PDCAs
find /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev [...] -path "*/pdca/*" -name "*.md" | sort

# Check for existing metadata
grep "PDCA TRACEABILITY METADATA" /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev/pdca
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Confirmed 70+ PDCAs need metadata updates
  - Verified 5 diary entries need PDCA linkage
  - No existing traceability metadata found in journal PDCAs
  - Diary content confirms connections to specific PDCAs
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
  > i have a major cleanup task. read all pdcas from scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-17-1305-sprint5-dev onwards and all diary entries you find. diligently link the diary entries to the original pdcas where the experience really happened. add the sha metadata and previous pdca link in double format where its missing
- Artifacts analyzed:
  - [diary.entry.md](../../project.journal/2025-08-18-0833-recovery/diary.entry.md) - References "42 = FOR TWO" PDCA
  - [2025-08-18-UTC-0850-life-universe-everything-42-revelation.md](../../project.journal/2025-08-18-0833-recovery/pdca/role/developer/2025-08-18-UTC-0850-life-universe-everything-42-revelation.md) - Source PDCA for diary experience
- Evidence:
```
# Diary mentions specific PDCA experience:
"I literally got excited and forgot to create the PDCA document! TRON had to remind me"

# This directly references:
/2025-08-18-0833-recovery/pdca/role/developer/2025-08-18-UTC-0850-life-universe-everything-42-revelation.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Create template for journal PDCA metadata
  - Establish diary-to-PDCA linking standard
  - Consider automated metadata checker
- Automation to add:
  - PDCA metadata validation script
  - Diary linkage verification tool
  - SHA lookup automation
- Follow-ups:
  - Execute the cleanup updates
  - Verify all links work
  - Create documentation for future journal entries
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: Begin systematic updates to all identified files
