# PDCA Entry - Tool Subsystem Failure Incident Documentation

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Document the tool subsystem failure incident during journal cleanup
  - Analyze the failure pattern and recovery
  - Establish preventive measures for future operations
  - Create knowledge base for similar incidents
- **Scope:** 
  - Tool failure cascade starting at ~11:45 UTC
  - Recovery at ~12:15 UTC
  - Impact on journal cleanup task
  - Analysis of failure pattern
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - Complete incident documentation
  - Root cause hypothesis
  - Preventive measures identified
  - Recovery procedures documented
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - Conversation log showing failure sequence
  - Successfully created files before failure
  - File that triggered the failure
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Incident fully documented
  - Timeline established
  - Recovery confirmed
  - Lessons learned captured
- **Assumptions:**
  - Transient system issue
  - No data corruption
  - Tools self-recovered
- **Constraints:**
  - Cannot reproduce at will
  - Limited visibility into tool internals
  - Cursor-specific architecture unknown
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Document and continue (selected)
    - Pros: Captures knowledge, can proceed with work
    - Cons: Root cause unknown
  - Option 2: Attempt to reproduce
    - Pros: Better understanding
    - Cons: Risk of another failure
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Documentation preserves incident details
  - Allows work to continue safely
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Recurrence during continued work
  - Mitigation: Save state frequently, smaller operations

## Do
- Actions executed:
  1. Identified failure start: search_replace operation on developer diary
  2. Documented cascade pattern: search_replace ‚Üí all tools fail
  3. Waited approximately 30 minutes
  4. Tested recovery with simple pwd command
  5. Confirmed full functionality restored
  6. Verified affected file still exists and is accessible
  7. Creating this incident documentation
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - [This PDCA](./2025-08-20-UTC-1215.md) - Incident documentation
- Commands run:
```bash
# Recovery test
pwd  # Success - confirmed tools working

# Functionality test  
echo "Tools are working again"  # Success

# File accessibility check
ls -la /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-19-1100-tsranger-v21-sprint/developer-diary-unguided-v21-sprint.md
# Success - file exists and is readable
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Tool functionality restored: ‚úÖ
  - File system accessible: ‚úÖ
  - Previous work intact: ‚úÖ
  - Can continue operations: ‚úÖ
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
  > can you elaborate on the last successful thing you did
  > try a pwd command
  > 3 [create PDCA for incident]
- Failure Timeline:
  1. **~11:40** - Successfully created cleanup-summary.md
  2. **~11:45** - First search_replace failure (normal error)
  3. **~11:46** - Read file successfully (still working)
  4. **~11:47** - Second search_replace (bizarre "path does not exist" error)
  5. **~11:47-12:14** - Complete tool subsystem failure
  6. **~12:15** - Tools working again
- Evidence:
```
# Last success
<function_results>Wrote contents to /workspace/scrum.pmo/project.journal/cleanup-summary.md.</function_results>

# First failure
Error: "The string to replace was not found in the file"

# Critical failure  
Error: "This path does not exist, but old_string is not empty"

# Cascade
Error calling tool: Tool call failed [all subsequent calls]
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Use smaller search_replace operations
  - Verify file state before complex operations
  - Create checkpoints during large cleanup tasks
  - Test with simple command if suspicious behavior
- Automation to add:
  - Tool health check script
  - Automated state saves during batch operations
  - Failure detection and reporting
- Follow-ups:
  - Complete the journal cleanup task
  - Monitor for recurrence
  - Report to Cursor team if pattern repeats
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: Continue with journal cleanup task

## Incident Analysis

### Failure Pattern:
1. **Trigger**: Multiple failed search_replace attempts on same file
2. **Escalation**: Normal error ‚Üí Impossible error ‚Üí Total failure
3. **Scope**: All tool types affected (file, terminal, todo)
4. **Duration**: ~30 minutes
5. **Recovery**: Spontaneous/automatic

### Hypothesis:
- Search_replace failures may have corrupted internal file handle state
- Tool subsystem detected corruption and went into failure mode
- Automatic cleanup/restart after timeout period
- Similar to connection pool exhaustion with auto-recovery

### Preventive Measures:
1. **Avoid rapid retry** on failed search_replace operations
2. **Check file state** between operations
3. **Use smaller replacements** for large files
4. **Save work frequently** during bulk operations
5. **Test basic command** if unexpected errors occur

### Recovery Procedure:
1. Stop attempting operations
2. Wait 10-30 minutes
3. Test with `pwd` or `echo`
4. Verify file accessibility
5. Resume work cautiously
