# PDCA Entry - Backend Agent Recovery and Roles Merge

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Perform autonomous recovery from README and merge updated role processes from release/dev
  - Understand current project state and prepare for next development tasks
- **Scope:** 
  - Recovery process execution
  - Environment verification
  - Roles directory merge from release/dev branch
  - Test suite status assessment
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - 100% recovery process completion
  - Successful merge of roles directory
  - Document all findings in recovery.md
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - /workspace/README.md (recovery procedure)
  - /workspace/handover.backend.agent.md
  - /workspace/recovery.md
  - /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ (from release/dev)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Recovery completed autonomously
  - Environment verified (Node.js, npm)
  - Roles directory successfully merged
  - Current project state documented
- **Assumptions:**
  - Working in cursor/recover-from-readme-file-a627 branch
  - Git repository is accessible
  - Node.js environment is functional
- **Constraints:**
  - Docker, PlantUML, and Graphviz not available locally
  - Must use devcontainer when available
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Full recovery then merge (selected)
    - Pros: Understand state before making changes
    - Cons: Takes more time
  - Option 2: Merge first then recover
    - Pros: Faster
    - Cons: Risk of conflicts or misunderstanding
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Need to understand project state before making structural changes
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Merge conflicts
  - Mitigation: Clean working directory before merge

## Do
- Actions executed:
  1. Read README.md recovery procedure
  2. Read handover.backend.agent.md
  3. Scanned project structure and recovery.md
  4. Verified environment (Node.js v22.16.0, npm 10.9.2)
  5. Ran npm ci to install dependencies
  6. Executed test suite (12 passed, 1 failed with 4 failing tests)
  7. Fetched and merged roles directory from release/dev
  8. Committed merge with descriptive message
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - [recovery.md](../../../recovery.md) - Added 2025-01-13 recovery entry
  - [scrum.pmo/roles/](../../) - Merged 7 new agent roles and updated existing ones
- Commands run:
```bash
# Environment verification
docker version 2>&1 | cat
node --version && npm --version
which plantuml 2>&1 || echo "PlantUML not found"
which dot 2>&1 || echo "Graphviz not found"

# Project setup
npm ci 2>&1 | cat
npm test 2>&1 | cat

# Git operations
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin release/dev
git checkout origin/release/dev -- scrum.pmo/roles/
git commit -m "Merge roles directory from release/dev to update processes"
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Environment meets Node.js requirements (v22.16.0 > v18+)
  - All dependencies installed successfully
  - Test suite shows 4 failing tests in tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts
  - Roles directory merge completed without conflicts
  - 121 files changed, 14845 insertions, 5 deletions
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
  > merge the roles directory from release/dev into the current branch to update the processes
- Artifacts analyzed:
  - [README.md](../../../README.md) - Recovery procedure and project principles
  - [qa-feedback-log.md](../../../qa-feedback-log.md) - Historical QA feedback
  - [index.md](../../../index.md) - Project structure index
- GitHub Links:
  - Repository: [Web4Articles](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles)
  - Branch: cursor/recover-from-readme-file-a627
- Evidence:
```bash
# Test results showing failures
Test Files  1 failed | 12 passed (13)
Tests  4 failed | 53 passed | 1 skipped (58)

# New roles added
ls -la scrum.pmo/roles/ | grep -E "Agent|Storyteller"
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Fix failing tests before proceeding with new development
  - Install PlantUML and Graphviz in devcontainer
  - Create BackendAgent process.md file
- Automation to add:
  - Automated PDCA creation script
  - Test failure tracking in PDCA
- Follow-ups:
  - Fix 4 failing tests in tsranger.promptline.behavior.test.ts
  - Begin Sprint 6 Task 1: Architect versioned folder structure
  - Create process.md for BackendAgent role
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: commit and push to current branch.
