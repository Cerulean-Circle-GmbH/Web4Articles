# PDCA (Cycle) â€” Improve PDCA quality, robustness, and Act linking

## Plan
- **Objective:** Address PDCA quality gaps, reflect prior shell script crashes, and include dual-link list of changed files in Act
- **Scope:** Harden tool script against crashes; enrich previous PDCA; write this PDCA
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 tool hardened; 1 PDCA enriched; 1 new PDCA created
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Script tolerates missing token and backtick/printf issues
  - Previous PDCA includes risks and Act dual-links to changed files
- **Assumptions:** GitHub token may be absent
- **Constraints:** Bash-only
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: API calls fail; Mitigation: skip PR lookup when token absent
  - Risk: printf parses options; Mitigation: print via %s and escaped backticks

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Updated tool to make PR lookup optional without token; use safe printf
  - Enriched PDCA 1035 with risks and Act links
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Script runs without errors and regenerates report
  - PDCA 1035 contains risk section and dual-link Act entries
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> your PDCA lacs quality. your thinking process did not reflect that you had problems with crashing shell srcipts previously. also it does not reflect which files you changed in the md linking format in the act section additionally to what you wrote in act. write a pdca aubeout this prompt but also enrich the previous entry with the required changes.
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
rg -n "Risks and Mitigations" scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md
rg -n "Changed artifacts \(GitHub first, then relative\)" scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md
```

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/feature/branchStatusAgent/scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh): [scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh](../../roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/feature/branchStatusAgent/scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md): [scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1035.md)
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Add a dry-run mode and verbose flag to the tool
- Automation to add:
  - Pre-commit check for dual-link format in PDCA Act sections
- Follow-ups:
  - Continue PDCA per prompt
