# PDCA (Cycle) — Reuse favorite generator in recovery journal

## Plan
- **Objective:** Ensure recovery journals can be generated with the favorite branch overview format.
- **Scope:** Invoke tool from recovery context; validate output sections and counts.
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 new journal created with favorite format.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Branch overview includes unmerged→dev, unmerged→main, merged→main, protected, summary.
- **Assumptions:** Remotes available; minimal without token.
- **Constraints:** None beyond non-interactive.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: API rate or token absence; Mitigation: degrade to “No PR lookup”.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Ran favorite generator to produce `2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md` during recovery.
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - File present with expected sections and counts.
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> yes, go on and keep creating the pdca logs
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
head -n 40 scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
```

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md): [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md](../../../project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md)
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Add background agent link detection heuristics.
- Automation to add:
  - Parameterize output path and base refs; add dry-run and verbose.
- Follow-ups:
  - Assist ReleaseIntegrationAgent with curated PR generation.
