# PDCA (Cycle) — Merge release/dev and create branch report

## Plan
- **Objective:** Sync current branch with `release/dev` and generate a fresh branch overview in favorite format
- **Scope:** Resolve conflicts, take upstream for recover.md; generate journal branch overview
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 merge completed; 1 report created
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/recover.md
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Merge commit present; report exists under today’s journal with release/dev-first ordering
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: merge conflicts; Mitigation: prefer upstream file for PDCA handover

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Merged `origin/release/dev` into `feature/branchStatusAgent`
  - Resolved conflict by taking release/dev version of recover.md
  - Generated new branch overview at a new timestamped journal path
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
git merge --no-ff origin/release/dev -m "merge: sync from release/dev"
git checkout --theirs scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/recover.md && git add ... && git commit -m "merge: resolve recover.md"
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh scrum.pmo/project.journal/$(date -u +%F-%H%M)/branch-overview.md
```

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> merge again and create a branchreport
- Verifications performed:
  - Journal file created and contains release/dev section first, then main

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/feature/branchStatusAgent/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-14-1617/branch-overview.md): [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-14-1617/branch-overview.md](../../project.journal/2025-08-14-1617/branch-overview.md)

- Follow-ups:
  - Open PR summarizing the merge and updated reporting
