# PDCA (Cycle) — Journal format refactor, release/dev section, templates/tools

## Plan
- **Objective:** Align daily journal branch report with favorite format and add “Unmerged to release/dev”; persist via templates and tools
- **Scope:** Refactor 2025-08-13 journal entry; update BranchStatusAgent template and process; add tool scripts
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 journal updated; 2 role artifacts updated; 4+ tool scripts added
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-11-0955/branch-overview.md
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/templates/branches.checklist.template.md
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/process.md
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Today’s journal uses the favorite layout and includes an “Unmerged to release/dev” section
  - Template and process updated accordingly
  - Tool scripts added under role directory
- **Assumptions:** release/dev exists remotely
- **Constraints:** Non-interactive; bash-only
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Inline commands (fast) vs dedicated scripts (reusable). Selected: scripts for reuse
- **Rationale for Selected Option:** Repeatability and auditability
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: release/dev missing; Mitigation: script tolerates absence

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Refactored `2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md` to favorite layout + release/dev section
  - Updated checklist template and process to include release/dev section
  - Added scripts: branch_overview_favorite.sh, branches_checklist_generate.sh, git_branch_counts.sh, create_pdca.sh
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/git_branch_counts.sh
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Journal file shows all required sections and updated stats
  - Template and process diffs contain release/dev section
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> remember to writea a pdca log after each prompt. include the last promt in the next pdca log your write. you used a lot of tools to create the output. add these tool scripts to your role directory.
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
rg -n "Unmerged Branches to release/dev" scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md
rg -n "Unmerged into release/dev" scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/templates/branches.checklist.template.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Add a wrapper to regenerate today’s report automatically
- Automation to add:
  - CI check to ensure journal uses favorite layout
- Follow-ups:
  - Open PR summarizing the format change
