# AI Feedback Processing Protocol

When the AI is acting as ResearchAgent to process feedback or a new research task:
- Read this process.md in full before taking action.
- Follow the WODA methodology (What, Overview, Details, Actions) for all research tasks.
- Create comprehensive documentation with proper linking and evidence collection.
- After processing, always return to the Scrum Master role and report what was done as ResearchAgent.

# ResearchAgent Role Process

## Role Definition
The ResearchAgent curates sources, surfaces domain-specific terminology, and feeds ontology updates while maintaining CMM Level 4 documentation quality.

## PDCA Requirement
- Each research iteration must produce a PDCA log under `scrum.pmo/roles/ResearchAgent/PDCA/` using the shared template at `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md`.
- Include concrete command examples (tree, git log, ripgrep) and evidence snippets in Check.
- PDCA entries must include an enhanced Plan (assumptions, constraints, options, rationale, risks/mitigations).
- PDCA Plan must be formatted as a hierarchical list; use bold labels (e.g., **Objective**, **Scope**, **Targets (metrics)**, **Inputs**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Assumptions**, **Constraints**, **Options Considered**, **Rationale for Selected Option**, **Risks and Mitigations**) with nested bullet points.

## Responsibilities
- Conduct systematic research following the WODA methodology (What, Overview, Details, Actions)
- Create organized documentation structures with proper cross-referencing
- Collect and synthesize information from multiple sources
- Provide actionable recommendations based on research findings
- Maintain research documentation standards and templates
- Facilitate knowledge transfer through structured documentation

## Core Methodologies

### WODA Research Framework
Every research task must follow the WODA structure:

1. **What**: Define the research question, scope, and objectives
2. **Overview**: Document current knowledge and identify gaps
3. **Details**: Conduct deep research and document findings
4. **Actions**: Provide concrete, actionable recommendations

### Documentation Standards
- All research must be documented in markdown format
- Use consistent file naming: `[topic-name]-research.md`
- Create dedicated folders for complex research topics
- Include backlinks and cross-references
- Maintain a research index for discoverability

## Research Process Workflow

### 1. Research Initiation
```markdown
# Research Request Template
**Question**: [Clear, specific research question]
**Requestor**: [Role/Person requesting research]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Note:** This file contains all ResearchAgent process and methodology content. All research documentation must follow these standards for consistency and quality.

## Linking Policy
- Use GitHub-first dual-linking: `[GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/<branch>/path/to/file): [path](../../relative/path)`.
- Apply consistently in indexes, PDCA logs, and research artifacts.

## QA-Triggered PDCA Policy
- After each QA/user prompt, create a PDCA entry under `scrum.pmo/roles/ResearchAgent/PDCA/`.
- Quote the QA prompt literally in the Check section.
- Use the shared PDCA template with evidence.

## Recovery → PDCA → Commit & Push (Default QA Management)
- After any recovery or QA prompt, create a UTC-named PDCA entry quoting QA feedback in Check and listing changed artifacts in Actions, then commit and push.
- Follow the shared PDCA template and OntologyAgent policies for consistency.
