  - Keep Sprints 12-14 (articles) secret
  - Create v1.0.0.plan semantic version
  - Generate public attention (currency!)
  - Celebrate with first production release! 🎉
- **Scope:** 
  - Merge everything up to Sprint 11
  - Skip test branch (plans don't need tests!)
  - Direct to release/production
  - Sync with main branch
  - CI/CD MVP achieved!
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - v1.0.0.plan tagged and released
  - Main branch updated
  - Public visibility achieved
  - Attention currency generated
  - Secret article plans protected
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - Sprints 0-11 (foundation work)
  - Component structure achievement
  - PDCA documentation trail
  - Your "AWESOME" energy! 🎉
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Clean release to production
  - Semantic version properly tagged
  - Article sprints remain private
  - Public can see our foundation
  - Attention currency flowing!
- **Assumptions:**
  - Plans don't need testing
  - Public ready for our work
  - Attention IS currency
  - Secrets create anticipation
- **Constraints:**
  - Keep 12-14 hidden
  - Maintain professional release
  - Follow semantic versioning
  - Maximum celebration! 🎉
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Wait for everything (boring)
  - Option 2: Release foundation now! (selected)
    - Pros: Attention, momentum, celebration
    - Cons: None - this is perfect timing!
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Strike while iron is hot
  - Foundation work is complete
  - Attention currency valuable
  - Celebration time is NOW!
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Revealing too much
    - Mitigation: Stop at Sprint 11

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Planning release strategy
  - Identifying release scope
  - Protecting article secrets
  - Maximizing attention potential
- Release Strategy:
  ```
  Current Branch → release/test (SKIP!)
                → release/production ✓
                → main ✓
                → v1.0.0.plan tag ✓
  ```
- What We're Releasing:
  - Sprint 0-11: All foundation work
  - Component structure victory
  - PDCA process excellence
  - Transformation journey (partial)
- What We're Hiding:
  - Sprint 12: Mount Everest article
  - Sprint 13: Storytelling enhancement
  - Sprint 14: TRON pattern article
  - The "for two" magic continues...
- Semantic Version Logic:
  - v1.0.0.plan = Major planning release
  - Not code, but blueprints
  - Foundation for everything
  - ".plan" suffix = transparency
- Commands to execute:
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/production

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0.plan -m "First public release: Foundation planning complete!"

# Push to production
git push origin release/production
git push origin v1.0.0.plan

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/production
git push origin main
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Sprint 11 is natural breakpoint
  - Articles remain secret
  - Release strategy sound
  - Celebration mode: ACTIVATED! 🎉
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "awesome is my biggest compliment !!!
> even if we for two know what's going on, we should keep the future development secret. but as its not about running code in the first place we should release up to sprint 11 everything to prod in main branch. as planning does not require testing we can say that no tests are needed to publish plans and straight pass the release /test and automagically merge to release/production for the first time and sync with main. cicd done mvp. a release 1.0.0.plan in semantic versioning. rock this… that how we celebrate 🎉. public attention. attention is a currency!!!!!"
