# PDCA - Understanding Component Directory Structure Misalignment

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Analyze the misunderstanding about component directory structure in Sprint 7
  - Understand the correct relationship between versioned folders and component organization
  - Plan corrective actions without implementing them yet
- **Scope:** 
  - [Sprint 6 componentization tasks](../../../sprints/sprint-6/task-6-architect-componentization-and-submodules.md)
  - [Sprint 7 Task 2.1](../../../sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md) structure
  - Component vs internal organization understanding
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - Clear understanding of the distinction between component-level and internal structure
  - Documented learning about the misinterpretation
  - Actionable plan for correction
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - [Sprint 6 planning](../../../sprints/sprint-6/planning.md) and component tasks
  - [Sprint 7 task 2.1](../../../sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md)
  - QA feedback about component directory
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Clear understanding of what went wrong
  - Documented distinction between Sprint 6 and Sprint 7 structures
  - Plan for correcting the documentation
- **Assumptions:**
  - Sprint 6 defined top-level component organization
  - Sprint 7 should focus on internal TSRanger v2.5 structure
  - Components are separate concerns from internal architecture
- **Constraints:**
  - Must not implement changes yet (per user request)
  - Must preserve Sprint 6 component architecture concepts
  - Must maintain clear separation of concerns
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Keep current mixed structure
    - Pros: Work already done
    - Cons: Confuses component-level with internal structure
  - Option 2: Revert to layer-based internal structure
    - Pros: Aligns with original v2 approach
    - Cons: May not leverage component benefits internally
  - Option 3: Clarify two-level organization (selected)
    - Pros: Preserves both concepts appropriately
    - Cons: Requires careful documentation
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Sprint 6 components/ is for separating major tools (TSRanger, GitScrumProject)
  - Sprint 7 internal structure is within TSRanger component
  - Two different organizational levels serve different purposes
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Further confusion about organizational levels
    - Mitigation: Clear documentation with examples
  - Risk: Inconsistent implementation
    - Mitigation: Define clear boundaries and responsibilities

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Searched for component directory references across SCRUM PMO
  - Read [Sprint 6 componentization plan](../../../sprints/sprint-6/task-6-architect-componentization-and-submodules.md)
  - Analyzed [Sprint 6 Task 6.1](../../../sprints/sprint-6/task-6.1-developer-refactor-components.md) for component structure
  - Reviewed [Sprint 7 Task 2.1](../../../sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md) current state
  - Identified the confusion between component-level and internal organization
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
# Search for component structure references
rg -i "components/TSRanger|components/GitScrumProject" /workspace/scrum.pmo -C 3

# Look for Sprint 6 component plans
grep -A 10 "Component boundaries" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-6/task-6-architect-componentization-and-submodules.md

# Check current Sprint 7 structure
cat /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Sprint 6 defines: `components/TSRanger/` and `components/GitScrumProject/` as separate repos/submodules
  - Sprint 7 Task 2.1 incorrectly shows: `src.v2.5/components/io/`, `model/`, `controller/`, `view/`
  - These are two different organizational concepts being conflated
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "the Task 2.1 is totally wrong with the fixed component structureâ€¦ read all the retro answers and the component directory and find out what i mean"
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
# Sprint 6 component structure (correct for top-level)
components/
  TSRanger/                    # Entire TSRanger component
    (submodule)               # Its own repo
  GitScrumProject/            # Entire GitScrumProject component
    (submodule)               # Its own repo

# Sprint 7 internal structure (should be WITHIN TSRanger)
components/TSRanger/src.v2.5/
  ts/
    io/                       # Internal organization
    model/                    # Internal organization
    controller/               # Internal organization
    view/                     # Internal organization
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Clearly distinguish between component-level and internal architecture
  - Update Sprint 7 Task 2.1 to show correct path within TSRanger component
  - Add documentation explaining the two organizational levels
- Automation to add:
  - Validation script to check path consistency
  - Documentation generator for component structure
- Follow-ups:
  - Update [Sprint 7 Task 2.1](../../../sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md) structure to:
    - Show paths relative to `components/TSRanger/`
    - Keep internal organization (io, model, controller, view) but at correct level
    - Clarify this is TSRanger's internal v2.5 structure
  - Update related Sprint 7 tasks to reflect correct paths
  - Add clarification to [sprints overview](../../../sprints/sprints.overview.md)
  - Document the distinction in architecture docs
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: Do NOT implement changes yet (per user request)
