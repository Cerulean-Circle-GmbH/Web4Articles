# PDCA - Final Understanding of Version Folder Structure

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Correctly understand the folder structure with version between component and src
  - Fix all Sprint 7 tasks with the proper hierarchy
  - Document the final understanding clearly
- **Scope:** 
  - Correct structure: `components/ComponentName/version/src/language`
  - Sprint 7 task updates with proper paths
  - Clear documentation of the hierarchy
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - Structure follows: `components/TSRanger/v2.5/src/ts/`
  - All paths in Sprint 7 updated correctly
  - No more confusion about folder hierarchy
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - QA feedback: "you miss the version between src and component"
  - Previous incorrect attempts
  - Clear specification of structure
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Version folder exists between component name and src
  - Path is: `components/TSRanger/v2.5/src/ts/`
  - All tasks reflect this structure
- **Assumptions:**
  - Version IS a folder in the filesystem
  - Version folder contains the src directory
  - This allows multiple versions to coexist
- **Constraints:**
  - Must follow exact hierarchy specified
  - Version folder naming follows semantic versioning
  - Structure must be consistent across all components
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Previous attempts were incorrect
  - Only one option: follow the specified structure exactly
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - QA has been clear about the requirement
  - Structure allows version isolation
  - Supports multiple versions in parallel
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: No more misunderstandings
    - Mitigation: Follow specification exactly

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Finally understood: version IS a folder between component and src
  - Correct path: `components/TSRanger/v2.5/src/ts/`
  - Realized my repeated errors in interpretation
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
# Correct structure visualization
tree components/
# components/
#   TSRanger/
#     v2.5/              # VERSION FOLDER HERE
#       src/
#         ts/
#           io/
#           layer2/
#           layer4/
#           layer5/
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - QA specified: "components/ComponentName/version/src/language"
  - Version goes BETWEEN component name and src
  - Not a git branch, but an actual folder
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "its still wrong. you miss the version between src and component"
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
# WRONG: components/TSRanger/src/ts/
# CORRECT: components/TSRanger/v2.5/src/ts/
#                               ^^^^^ version folder here
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Listen more carefully to explicit requirements
  - Don't overthink simple folder structures
  - Verify understanding before making changes
- Automation to add:
  - Folder structure validator
  - Path consistency checker
- Follow-ups:
  - Update task 2.1 immediately with correct structure
  - Fix all Sprint 7 task paths
  - Update routing paths in shell wrapper task
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: Fix all Sprint 7 tasks with correct paths
