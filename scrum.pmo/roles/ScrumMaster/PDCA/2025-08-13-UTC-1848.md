# PDCA - Refactoring PDCAs to Include Artifact Links

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Add artifact links to all recent PDCA entries for easier navigation and checking
  - Update processes to require artifact links in future PDCAs
  - Improve traceability and QA verification capabilities
- **Scope:** 
  - Recent PDCA entries in ScrumMaster role
  - ScrumMaster process documentation
  - Shared PDCA template
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - 100% of recent PDCAs have artifact links
  - Process documentation updated with requirement
  - Template includes artifact link sections
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - QA request: "link all pdcas to the changed artifacts for easier navigation and checking"
  - Recent PDCA entries (5 files from 2025-08-13)
  - [ScrumMaster process.md](../process.md)
  - [Shared PDCA template](../../_shared/PDCA/template.md)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All recent PDCAs include "Artifacts changed" sections with links
  - Process requires artifact links in PDCAs
  - Template has sections for artifact links
  - Links use relative paths for portability
- **Assumptions:**
  - Artifact links improve QA verification efficiency
  - Relative paths work across different environments
  - All roles will benefit from this pattern
- **Constraints:**
  - Must maintain existing PDCA structure
  - Cannot break existing content
  - Links must be relative, not absolute
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Add links only to new PDCAs
    - Pros: Less work
    - Cons: Inconsistent, misses existing PDCAs
  - Option 2: Retrofit all PDCAs and update process (selected)
    - Pros: Consistency, immediate benefit
    - Cons: More work upfront
  - Option 3: Create separate artifact tracking
    - Pros: Could be more detailed
    - Cons: Violates DRY, harder to maintain
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Provides immediate value to QA
  - Ensures consistency going forward
  - Keeps information co-located with PDCA entries
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Links could become stale
    - Mitigation: Use relative paths, verify during reviews
  - Risk: Added complexity to PDCA creation
    - Mitigation: Clear template and examples

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Added artifact links to 5 recent PDCA entries
  - Updated ScrumMaster process with artifact link requirement
  - Modified shared PDCA template with artifact sections
  - Added instructions for both changed and analyzed artifacts
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - [2025-08-13-UTC-1730.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1730.md) - Added 3 artifact links
  - [2025-08-13-UTC-1725.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1725.md) - Added 3 artifact links (noted as superseded)
  - [2025-08-13-UTC-1720.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1720.md) - Added 2 artifact links
  - [2025-08-13-UTC-1715.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1715.md) - Added 3 analyzed artifact links
  - [2025-08-13-UTC-1707.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1707.md) - Added 9 artifact links
  - [ScrumMaster process.md](../process.md) - Added artifact link requirement to PDCA Enforcement
  - [Shared PDCA template](../../_shared/PDCA/template.md) - Added artifact sections and instructions
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
# Count PDCAs updated
ls -la /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-*.md | wc -l

# Verify relative links work
cd /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/PDCA
grep -n "^\s*-.*\[.*\](" 2025-08-13-UTC-*.md | head -10
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - All 5 recent PDCAs now have artifact links
  - Process.md includes enforcement requirement
  - Template has both "changed" and "analyzed" sections
  - Links use consistent relative path format
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "link all pdcas to the changed artifacts for easier navigation and checking. update the processes to reflect that request"
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
# Verify artifact links added
grep -A5 "Artifacts changed" /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-*.md

# Check process update
grep -A5 "Artifact Links Requirement" /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/process.md

# Verify template update
grep -B2 -A2 "Artifacts changed" /workspace/scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Consider automated link validation tool
  - Add examples of good artifact link formatting
  - Create script to generate artifact links from git diff
- Automation to add:
  - Pre-commit hook to verify PDCA has artifact links
  - Link checker for relative paths
  - PDCA template generator with artifact sections
- Follow-ups:
  - Monitor adoption in other roles
  - Update other role-specific PDCA guidance if needed
  - Consider adding artifact links to older PDCAs if referenced
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: commit and push to current branch
