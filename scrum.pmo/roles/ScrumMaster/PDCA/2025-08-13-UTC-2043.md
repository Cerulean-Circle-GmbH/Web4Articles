# PDCA - Final Structure Clarification: Version Folders with Environment Specifiers

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Remove unnecessary v3.0 intermediate folder
  - Move v3.n14.4 and v3.njs14 to proper level
  - Document correct understanding of version structure
  - Ensure future agents understand the pattern
- **Scope:** 
  - Git move v3.* folders up one level
  - Remove v3.0 completely
  - Document version naming patterns
  - Clarify git tag/branch relationship
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - Zero nested version folders
  - All versions at same level
  - Clear documentation
  - No confusion remaining
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - User clarification on structure
  - v3.n14.4 and v3.njs14 as versions
  - No nested version pattern
  - Git tag/branch concept
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - v3.n14.4 at components/TSRanger/v3.n14.4
  - v3.njs14 at components/TSRanger/v3.njs14
  - v3.0 folder removed
  - Pattern documented clearly
- **Assumptions:**
  - Version folders can include environment specs
  - All versions at same hierarchy level
  - Git tags/branches manage actual versions
- **Constraints:**
  - Must preserve git history
  - Must be clear for future agents
  - Must follow established patterns
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Keep nested (wrong pattern)
  - Option 2: Flatten structure (selected)
    - Pros: Consistent, clear, correct
    - Cons: None - this is the right way
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Follows established pattern
  - No unnecessary nesting
  - Clear version identification
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Future confusion
    - Mitigation: Document clearly

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Moved v3.n14.4 up from v3.0/ to TSRanger/
  - Moved v3.njs14 up from v3.0/ to TSRanger/
  - Removed OBSOLETE warning file
  - v3.0 folder automatically removed
- Understanding clarified:
  - Version folders can have environment specifiers
  - v3.n14.4 = version 3 for Node 14.4
  - v3.njs14 = version 3 for Node.js 14
  - NOT nested versions, just descriptive names
- Correct pattern:
  ```
  components/ComponentName/version/src/language
  where version can be:
  - Simple: v1.0, v2.0, v2.5
  - With environment: v3.n14.4, v3.njs14
  ```
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - Moved v3.n14.4 up one level
  - Moved v3.njs14 up one level
  - Removed v3.0 folder completely
  - This PDCA documenting understanding
- Git commands executed:
```bash
git mv components/TSRanger/v3.0/v3.n14.4 components/TSRanger/v3.n14.4
git mv components/TSRanger/v3.0/v3.njs14 components/TSRanger/v3.njs14
git rm components/TSRanger/v3.0/OBSOLETE_DO_NOT_USE.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - All versions now at same level
  - No nested version folders
  - Structure makes sense
  - Pattern is consistent
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "no mistake any more... but really remove the v3.0 folders and git move the v3.... folders up. they are version folders for special environments probably node14.4 and a pure node javascript version for node 14. there is no pattern component/version/version/src as version is intended to be a git tag or git branch."
- Key insights:
  - v3.n14.4 and v3.njs14 ARE versions
  - They specify environments in the name
  - No nested version pattern exists
  - Version = git tag/branch conceptually

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Remember versions can have specifiers
  - Don't create intermediate folders
  - Keep all versions at same level
  - Document environment requirements
- Automation to add:
  - Version naming validator
  - Structure consistency checker
  - Environment specifier documentation
- Follow-ups:
  - Update architecture docs
  - Ensure all agents understand
  - Document version naming conventions
- Final structure achieved:
  ```
  components/TSRanger/
  ├── v1.0/        # Original version
  ├── v2.0/        # Version 2
  ├── v2.5/        # Version 2.5
  ├── v3.n14.4/    # Version 3 for Node 14.4
  └── v3.njs14/    # Version 3 for Node.js 14
  ```

## Version Naming Convention Clarified

### Pattern:
`v{major}.{minor/environment}`

### Examples:
- **v1.0** - Standard version 1.0
- **v2.5** - Standard version 2.5
- **v3.n14.4** - Version 3 built for Node 14.4
- **v3.njs14** - Version 3 built for Node.js 14

### Key Understanding:
- The version folder IS the version (with optional environment)
- No nesting of version folders
- Git tags/branches track the actual code versions
- Folder names can include environment specifications
