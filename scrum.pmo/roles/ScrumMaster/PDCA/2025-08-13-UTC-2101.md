# PDCA - Separate PlantUML Source and Generated SVG Files

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Separate .puml source files from .svg generated files
  - Better organization of source vs generated content
  - Apply to all components consistently
  - Clean folder structure
- **Scope:** 
  - GitScrumProject puml/svg files
  - Check other components
  - Create svg folders where needed
  - Move all svg files
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - puml/ contains only .puml files
  - svg/ contains only .svg files
  - Clear separation maintained
  - Pattern applied everywhere
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - Mixed puml folder with both types
  - User guidance on separation
  - 2 .puml and 2 .svg files
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Separate puml/ and svg/ folders
  - All files in correct locations
  - Git history preserved
  - Pattern documented
- **Assumptions:**
  - .puml = source files
  - .svg = generated output
  - Should be separated
- **Constraints:**
  - Use git mv
  - Maintain structure
  - Apply consistently
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Keep mixed (messy)
  - Option 2: Separate folders (selected)
    - Pros: Clear organization, source vs output
    - Cons: None - this is cleaner
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Source and generated files differ
  - Easier to manage separately
  - Cleaner git history
  - Better organization
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: None really
    - Mitigation: Simple move operation

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Created svg folder in GitScrumProject
  - Moved .svg files to separate folder
  - Checked other components (none needed)
  - Clean separation achieved
- Understanding reinforced:
  - Components = separate tools/libraries
  - Each component has its own structure
  - Source vs generated separation is good
  - Clean organization matters
- Commands executed:
```bash
# Create svg folder
mkdir -p components/GitScrumProject/v1.0/src/svg

# Move SVG files
git mv components/GitScrumProject/v1.0/src/puml/*.svg \
       components/GitScrumProject/v1.0/src/svg/
```
- Result structure:
```
GitScrumProject/v1.0/src/
├── puml/      # Source PlantUML files
│   ├── GitScrumProject_CLI_Architecture.puml
│   └── GitScrumProject_TemplateAndRelease.puml
├── svg/       # Generated SVG diagrams
│   ├── GitScrumProject_CLI_Architecture.svg
│   └── GitScrumProject_TemplateAndRelease.svg
└── ts/        # TypeScript source
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - SVG files moved successfully
  - puml folder now contains only .puml
  - svg folder contains only .svg
  - No other components need this
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "amazing work. you now really understand what a component is. just seperate puml and svg into two folders"
- User appreciation:
  - Recognized understanding of components
  - Simple improvement suggestion
  - Clean organization valued

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Always separate source from generated
  - Apply patterns consistently
  - Keep exploring better organization
  - Document folder purposes
- Automation to add:
  - Build script to generate svg from puml
  - Git hooks to check separation
  - Documentation generator
- Follow-ups:
  - Apply to any new components
  - Consider .gitignore for generated files
  - Document the pattern
- Key principle:
  ```
  source files → puml/
  generated files → svg/
  Never mix them!
  ```
