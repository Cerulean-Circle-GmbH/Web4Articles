# PDCA - Sprint 7 Documentation Correction and Sprints Overview Update

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Correct Sprint 7 documentation that incorrectly referenced Sprint 5 and v2 instead of v2.5
  - Update sprints overview with accurate Sprint 7 description highlighting component architecture
- **Scope:** 
  - All files in `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7/` directory
  - `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprints.overview.md` file
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - 100% of Sprint 5 references changed to Sprint 7
  - 100% of v2 references updated to v2.5 where appropriate
  - Component directory structure properly documented
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7/` (31 files)
  - `/workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprints.overview.md`
  - QA feedback about Sprint 7 discrepancies
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All Sprint 7 files correctly reference Sprint 7, not Sprint 5
  - Version references updated from v2 to v2.5
  - Component-based architecture clearly documented
  - Sprints overview accurately describes Sprint 7 goals
- **Assumptions:**
  - Sprint 7 is about TSRanger v2.5, not v2
  - Component directory structure replaces layer-based organization
  - Sprint 7 builds upon Sprint 5's v2 and Sprint 6's versioned folders
- **Constraints:**
  - Must preserve existing task structure and traceability
  - Cannot modify completed sprint status
  - Must maintain consistency with project principles
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Quick find/replace across all files
    - Pros: Fast execution
    - Cons: Risk of incorrect replacements, missing context
  - Option 2: Manual review and targeted updates
    - Pros: Accurate, context-aware changes
    - Cons: Time-consuming
  - Option 3: Automated search with manual verification (selected)
    - Pros: Balance of speed and accuracy
    - Cons: Still requires significant manual effort
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Grep searches helped identify all affected files
  - Manual review ensured context-appropriate changes
  - Preserved semantic meaning while fixing references
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Missing some v2 references
    - Mitigation: Used multiple grep patterns to find variations
  - Risk: Breaking existing links or references
    - Mitigation: Preserved file names, only updated content
  - Risk: Inconsistent updates across files
    - Mitigation: Systematic approach, file-by-file verification

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Read Sprint 7 requirements file discovering v2.5 references
  - Searched for component directory references
  - Updated planning.md: Sprint 5 → Sprint 7, v2 → v2.5
  - Fixed requirements.md header and marked corrections complete
  - Updated qa.md Sprint references
  - Corrected task files with proper Sprint 7 and v2.5 references
  - Modified task-2.1 to show component-based structure
  - Updated sprints.overview.md with accurate Sprint 7 description
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
# Search for component and v2.5 references
rg -i "component|v2\.5|version.*2\.5" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7

# Find files with v2 references needing updates
rg --files-with-matches "src\.v2/|src\.v2\s|v2\s+" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7

# Verify Sprint 7 planning after updates
head -20 /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7/planning.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - All Sprint 7 files now correctly reference Sprint 7
  - Version references updated to v2.5 throughout
  - Component directory structure documented in task-2.1
  - Sprints overview accurately describes Sprint 7
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "i agree that all files in sprint 7 talk about sprint 5 and have to be corrected. also they talk about v2 but actually should talk about v2.5. read through the sprint 7 files and fix that. look for a task talking about a component directory"
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
# Verify no more "Sprint 5" in headers
rg "^#.*Sprint 5" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7 || echo "No Sprint 5 headers found"

# Check component structure is documented
grep -A 10 "Proposed Structure" /workspace/scrum.pmo/sprints/sprint-7/task-2.1-architect-srcv2-structure.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Create automated validation for sprint number consistency
  - Add pre-commit hooks to check version references
  - Document version naming conventions clearly
- Automation to add:
  - Script to validate sprint folder contents match sprint number
  - Tool to check cross-references between sprints
- Follow-ups:
  - Verify actual implementation matches documented v2.5 structure
  - Update any remaining documentation referencing old structure
  - Consider similar review for other sprint folders
- After completing this PDCA entry, execute: commit and push to current branch.
