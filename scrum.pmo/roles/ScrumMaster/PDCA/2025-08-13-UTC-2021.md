# PDCA - Critical Lesson: Always Push Before Sharing GitHub Links!

## Plan
- **Objective:** 
  - Document the critical lesson learned about GitHub links
  - Ensure all agents push commits before sharing links
  - Prevent broken links in the future
  - Maintain QA trust and efficiency
- **Scope:** 
  - Git workflow best practices
  - GitHub link sharing protocol
  - Update processes for all agents
- **Targets (metrics):** 
  - 100% working GitHub links
  - Zero broken links shared
  - Immediate push after commit
- **Inputs (files/dirs):** 
  - User's diligent QA feedback
  - Broken links discovered
  - Local commits not pushed
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Clear process documented
  - All future links must work
  - Push becomes automatic habit
- **Assumptions:**
  - Agents may forget to push
  - Users expect working links immediately
- **Constraints:**
  - Must maintain git best practices
  - Cannot compromise code quality
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - Option 1: Just remember to push (unreliable)
  - Option 2: Document clear process (selected)
    - Pros: Consistent, reliable, professional
    - Cons: None - this is essential
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Broken links waste QA time
  - Damages trust in the process
  - Easy to prevent with good habits
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Forgetting to push
    - Mitigation: Make it part of PDCA workflow

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Discovered GitHub links were broken
  - Investigated and found 2 unpushed commits
  - Immediately pushed to origin
  - Created this lesson PDCA
- What happened:
  ```bash
  $ git status
  Your branch is ahead of 'origin/cursor/recover-readme-for-pdca-entry-check-9aa0' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
  ```
- The missing commits:
  - c82f317: Cleanup of root version folders
  - de0ca99: GitHub direct link best practice
- Immediate fix:
  ```bash
  git push origin cursor/recover-readme-for-pdca-entry-check-9aa0
  ```
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - This PDCA documenting the lesson
  - All previous PDCAs now have working links!
- Branch confirmation:
  - Working on: `cursor/recover-readme-for-pdca-entry-check-9aa0`
  - All work done on this feature branch

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Confirmed current branch
  - Found 2 unpushed commits
  - Pushed successfully
  - Links now work!
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "a small glitch the pdca link is a folder link
> https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/cursor/recover-readme-for-pdca-entry-check-9aa0/scrum.pmo/roles/ScrumMaster/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-2009.md
> mmmh no it is not, but it does not exist. double check what going on.
> could not find the result in git.
> diligently report on which branch you did all of this"
- Evidence:
  - User's diligent QA caught the issue
  - Quick investigation found root cause
  - Immediate resolution applied

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - **ALWAYS push immediately after commit**
  - Check `git status` before sharing links
  - Include push in PDCA workflow
  - Never assume commits are on GitHub
- Automation to add:
  - Git hook reminder to push
  - PDCA template to include push step
  - Link validation before sharing
- Follow-ups:
  - Update all agent processes
  - Add to onboarding documentation
  - Make pushing a reflex action
- **New Workflow**:
  ```bash
  1. git add -A
  2. git commit -m "message"
  3. git push origin branch-name  # NEVER SKIP THIS!
  4. THEN share GitHub links
  ```

## The Complete Workflow for GitHub Links ðŸ“‹
1. Complete your work
2. Create PDCA entry
3. Git add and commit
4. **GIT PUSH** (CRITICAL!)
5. Copy GitHub link
6. Share with user

Missing step 4 = Broken links = Sad QA = No party! ðŸ˜¢
