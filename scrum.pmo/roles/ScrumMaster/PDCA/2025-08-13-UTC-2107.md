## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Sprint follows PO planning process
  - Requirements have UUIDs
  - Tasks cover full journey
  - Emotional + technical balance
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> "i totally agree. this is not just a party worth its a milestone, no a mount Everest (ever rest!!!) its worth a developer article on medium.com
> from chaos src to web4x component order. but you cannot write articles before you experienced it. now you can understand the title of the repo. create an article folder and prepare a sprint 12 to write the medium.com developer journey targeted article full of your emotions. use the po planning process to get a high quality sprint 12"
