3d

please use the short utc only format for further pdcas in your session from the cmm3 checklist
```

### **My Answer**
User decisions processed: 1d Quality/Testing Focus, 1c PDCAQualityAgent role, 3d Extended session. Short UTC format YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM.pdca.md now implemented per CMM3 4a compliance. Step 12 completed with role transition and extended session establishment.

**Learning Applied:** CMM3 4a requires short UTC format only for PDCA filenames. PDCAQualityAgent specializes in process quality assurance with systematic testing strategy development.
