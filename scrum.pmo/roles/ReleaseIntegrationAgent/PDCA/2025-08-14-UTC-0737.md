## Plan
- **Objective:**
  - Merge `release/dev` into the current working branch and establish PDCA discipline for ReleaseIntegrationAgent based on OntologyAgent PDCA process.
- **Scope:**
  - Non-destructive fast-forward or content merge from `origin/release/dev` → current branch.
  - Create PDCA entry under `scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/` with link hygiene (repo/branch/PR links).
- **Targets (metrics):**
  - Merge succeeds without unresolved conflicts (0 pending conflicts).
  - PDCA committed and pushed in current branch within this cycle.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - `README.md` (recovery), `docs/branching-strategy.md`, `docs/devops-cicd-branching-strategy.md`
  - `merge-report-sprint-9.md`, `recovery.md`, `qa-feedback-log.md`
  - Shared template: `scrum.pmo/roles/_shared/PDCA/template.md`
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - `origin/release/dev` merged into current branch; working tree clean.
  - New PDCA file present and linked in status.
  - Uses GitHub links for repo/branches; relative links for local artifacts.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Git remotes configured; `origin/release/dev` is up to date.
- **Constraints:**
  - Non-interactive execution; no destructive rewrites of history.
- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - `git merge --no-edit origin/release/dev` (pro: preserves history; con: may need conflict resolution)
  - Rebase (pro: linear history; con: riskier for shared branches) — not chosen.
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - Aligns with CI strategy and preserves integration history from `release/dev`.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Wide file moves across components causing conflicts → Mitigation: rely on content-aware structure; review post-merge.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Fetched remotes and merged `origin/release/dev` into current branch.
  - Created PDCA entry documenting the merge and link hygiene adoption.
- Commands run (highlights):
```bash
# Identify branch and update refs
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git fetch origin

# Merge release/dev into current branch (non-interactive)
git merge --no-edit origin/release/dev

# Stage and commit PDCA
git add scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-14-UTC-0737.md
# git commit -m "docs(release-integrator): PDCA 2025-08-14-UTC-0737; merge origin/release/dev"
# git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

## Check
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> merge release/dev into the current branch. read the ontology role pdca process and create a pdca in releaseIntegrator. give me in the chat a direct github link to the pdca

- Verifications performed (to run locally):
```bash
# Confirm last merge commit references origin/release/dev
git log -1 --oneline

# Verify file exists and is staged/committed
git ls-files scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-14-UTC-0737.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Automate PDCA creation via a role tool (similar to BranchStatusAgent scripts).
  - Add CI job to validate presence of repo/branch/PR links in PDCA entries.
- Follow-ups:
  - If conflicts arise in future cycles, attach conflict summary and resolutions in Do/Check.
