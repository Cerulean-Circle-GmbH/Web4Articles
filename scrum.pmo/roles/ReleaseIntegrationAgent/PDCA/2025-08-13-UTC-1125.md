# PDCA (Cycle) — ReleaseIntegrationAgent — 2025-08-13 11:25 UTC

## Plan
- **Objective:** Produce a fully LLM-authored PDCA entry (no shell tooling), documenting the persistent shell/templating issues and the mitigation plan using TSRanger, GitScrumProject, and Web4x scenario automation.
- **Scope:** Integration-only; PDCA creation workflow, CI guardrails, role/process integration (no recovery tasks for this role).
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 PDCA created with detailed diagnostics; concrete, testable mitigation steps; dual-linked Act section.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - `.github/workflows/{feature-to-dev.yml,roles-auto-pr.yml,roles-pr-scan.yml,eod-merge.yml,quality-checks.yml}`
  - `scrum.pmo/templates/{project.state.template.md,branch-overview.template.md}`
  - `scrum.pmo/roles/{BranchStatusAgent,ReleaseIntegrationAgent}/**`
  - `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/{project.state.md,branch-overview.md}`
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - PDCA conforms to BranchStatusAgent format (bold Plan subsections; dual-link Act)
  - Issues described precisely with examples and paths
  - Clear, actionable mitigation with owners and checkpoints
- **Assumptions:** Work on `release/dev`; GitHub reachable; no interactive prompts available; macOS/BSD utils semantics apply. Recovery owned by ScrumMaster.
- **Constraints:** Non-interactive; avoid brittle one-liners; preserve repo integrity; maintain backlinks and cross-links.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Template placeholders leak into committed PDCA → Mitigation: CI check added; manual sweep; move to TS template rendering
  - Risk: Shell command interruptions/cancellations → Mitigation: deterministic TS CLIs and scenario runners
  - Risk: BSD vs GNU tooling differences (`sed`, `rg`) → Mitigation: avoid inline pipelines; use TS implementations

## Do
- Actions executed (context):
  - Clarified deprecation of recovery for this role; recovery belongs to ScrumMaster.
  - Added CI guardrails: auto-PR on roles changes; hourly scan; PDCA placeholder check
  - Integrated `OntologyAgent` role and PDCA cycles into `release/dev`
  - Authored `ReleaseIntegrationAgent` role with process and templates
  - Attempted scripted PDCA creation; observed interruptions and variable interpolation failures; switched to LLM-authored PDCA
- Problem symptoms encountered (representative examples):
  - Inline Node `-e` in zsh: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'` due to nested quotes/backticks in one-liners
  - BSD `sed -i ''` vs GNU `sed -i`: cross-platform flag semantics caused substitutions to fail silently or error
  - Missing `rg` (ripgrep) resulted in `bash: rg: command not found` in CI/local shells; fragile pipes aborted sequences
  - Long, concatenated pipelines made partial success hard to detect; terminal occasionally returned to prompt mid-pipeline (interruption)

## Check
- Verifications:
  - Current journal presents real branch/PR state (BranchStatusAgent format)
  - CI placeholder check present in `quality-checks.yml` and protects PDCA entries
  - Role import diff shows OntologyAgent process and PDCA present on `release/dev`
- QA Feedback (verbatim):
> remove the recover references from the ReleaseIntegrationAgent. this was only a one time need.
> make sure you always recover into branch release/dev
> update the process accordingly
- Evidence (snippets):
  - Paths: `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md`, `scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/process.md`
  - CI: `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml` (PDCA template var check)
  - Role imports: `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/**`

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1125.md): [scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1125.md](./2025-08-13-UTC-1125.md)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml): [.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml)
- Mitigation plan (scheduled in Sprint 11):
  - TS Tools (strict ESM, radical OOP):
    - PR Reporter (release/dev) → replaces PR curl/jq in shells
    - Journal Generator → renders `project.state.md` from template with typed inputs
    - Branch Overview Renderer → emits BranchStatusAgent-equivalent MD without shell
    - Protected-Path Scanner → structured JSON report for CI
  - TSRanger scenarios (non-interactive): encode “recover → generate overview → commit” as deterministic test sequences
  - GitScrumProject flows: standardize repo scaffolding to include these TS CLIs and CI wiring by default
  - Web4x scenarios: orchestrate cross-repo branch status and journaling via the same TS tools and scenario runners
- Immediate safeguards:
  - Prefer LLM-authored PDCA for now; avoid inline `-e` Node; no multi-command one-liners; keep changes atomic and auditable
