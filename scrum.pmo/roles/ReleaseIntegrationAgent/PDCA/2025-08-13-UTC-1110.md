# PDCA (Cycle) â€” Deprecate recovery responsibilities; focus on integration-only

## Plan
- **Objective:** Clarify that recovery is owned by the ScrumMaster; this role focuses only on integration to `release/dev`. Align PDCA formatting to high-quality standard.
- **Scope:** Integration-only; no recovery tasks under this role. PDCA formatting; documentation of changes.
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 journal created with favorite format; 1 PDCA created with improved formatting.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md (reference)
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1042.md (format reference)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Journal exists with unmerged/merged and protected sections; PDCA has bold-labeled plan subsections and dual-link Act.
- **Assumptions:** Work starts from `release/dev` and stays integration-scoped.
- **Constraints:** Non-destructive; no force-push; non-interactive.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Placeholder leakage; Mitigate: fully materialize sections.
  - Risk: Shell brittleness; Mitigate: reuse BranchStatusAgent tool; TS tooling planned in Sprint 11.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Documented deprecation of recovery for this role; reaffirmed integration-only scope.

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Role docs updated to remove recovery responsibilities.
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> remove the recover references from the ReleaseIntegrationAgent. this was only a one time need.
> make sure you always recover into branch release/dev
> update the process accordingly

## Act
- Changed artifacts:
  - Updated `scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/process.md` to remove recovery phrasing and add integration-only note.
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Add TS PR Reporter and Journal Generator (Sprint 11).
  - Enrich background agent links for cursor/* branches.
  - Ensure all docs for this role avoid recovery terminology.
