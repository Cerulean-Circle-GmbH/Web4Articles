# PDCA (Cycle) â€” Enhance recovery to use BranchStatusAgent format and log PDCA quality

## Plan
- **Objective:** Generate a recovery journal with the BranchStatusAgent favorite format and align PDCA formatting to high-quality standard.
- **Scope:** Recovery journal creation; branch overview generation; PDCA formatting; documentation of changes.
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 journal created with favorite format; 1 PDCA created with improved formatting.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md (reference)
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1042.md (format reference)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Journal exists with unmerged/merged and protected sections; PDCA has bold-labeled plan subsections and dual-link Act.
- **Assumptions:** GitHub accessible; no token still generates minimal output; release/dev is current.
- **Constraints:** Non-destructive; no force-push; non-interactive.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Placeholder leakage; Mitigate: fully materialize sections.
  - Risk: Shell brittleness; Mitigate: reuse BranchStatusAgent tool; TS tooling planned in Sprint 11.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Created new journal entry 2025-08-13-1102 and generated branch overview via BranchStatusAgent tool.
  - Committed and pushed journal.
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - Journal files exist and include categorized sections and counts.
  - PDCA includes bold plan subsections and dual-link Act entries.
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> ok, here is the lates scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1023/branch-overview.md created by the scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent create a new project journal entry as if zou would just now recover from readme, but enhance the recovery process to produce the same output as the scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent also update the formating fo your pdca enties to the one in this example scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1042.md
> yes, go on and keep creating the pdca logs
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
sed -n '1,120p' scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
```

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md): [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md](../../../project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/project.state.md): [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/project.state.md](../../../project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/project.state.md)
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Add TS PR Reporter and Journal Generator (Sprint 11).
  - Enrich background agent links for cursor/* branches.
- Automation to add:
  - Provide a single CLI entry to generate the branch overview deterministically.
- Follow-ups:
  - Continue integrating `feature/ontology-agent` via curated PR.
