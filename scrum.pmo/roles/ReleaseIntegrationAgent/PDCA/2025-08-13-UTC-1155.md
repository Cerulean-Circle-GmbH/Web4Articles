# PDCA (Cycle) â€” ReleaseIntegrationAgent

## Plan
- **Objective:** Manually continue PDCA logging despite tool failure; capture failure mode with concrete example and maintain auditability.
- **Scope:** PDCA creation only (manual); no tool fixes in this entry; document follow-ups.
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 PDCA created; includes failure reproduction and links.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh
  - scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Entry contains Plan/Do/Check/Act; quotes QA verbatim; shows failing command and output; dual-link Act.
- **Assumptions:** Repo write access; branch is release/dev.
- **Constraints:** Non-interactive; no script changes in this step.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Template variables remain unreplaced; Mitigation: avoid placeholders; hardcode links.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Attempted to run PDCA creator script for ReleaseIntegrationAgent with QA text and branch.
  - On failure, created this PDCA manually with correct formatting.
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
bash scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh ReleaseIntegrationAgent "try again and report in the PDCA what's going on with example" release/dev | tee /tmp/new_pdca_path.txt
# Observed: command interrupted; shell prompt printed; no file path returned
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - This PDCA file exists and follows BranchStatusAgent PDCA format (bold-labeled subsections).
  - No leftover template variables like ${REPO_URL}, ${BR}, ${JTS}.
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> looks like your tool is broken. create the pdca manually and fix the tool later.
> try anfain and report in the pdca whats going on with example
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
sed -n '1,120p' "scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1155.md"
```

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1155.md): [scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1155.md](scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1155.md)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh): [scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh](../../BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh)
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Fix PDCA tool to interpolate variables and return created path reliably.
  - Add retries and clearer error messages when invocation fails.
- Automation to add:
  - Ensure CI check blocks commits with leftover ${...} in PDCA entries (added separately).
- Follow-ups:
  - Implement PDCA tool fixes in a separate commit.
