# PDCA (Cycle) â€” ReleaseIntegrationAgent

## Plan
- **Objective:** Continue manual PDCA logging, document shell non-response issues, and outline mitigation with TSRanger + GitScrumProject and Web4x scenario tooling.
- **Scope:** PDCA logging; diagnosis of shell interruption; process hardening plan; no script edits in this entry.
- **Targets (metrics):** 1 PDCA created; includes concrete failure example and mitigation plan with dates/owners.
- **Inputs (files/dirs):**
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/branch_overview_favorite.sh
  - scrum.pmo/roles/BranchStatusAgent/tools/create_pdca.sh
  - scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Entry uses BranchStatusAgent PDCA format; quotes QA; dual-links in Act; provides clear mitigation steps (TS tools/Web4x scenarios).
- **Assumptions:** Work happens on release/dev; GitHub reachable for links; no token needed for PDCA creation.
- **Constraints:** Non-interactive; preserve repo integrity; avoid brittle one-liners.
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Shell jobs interrupted or terminal context switches â†’ Mitigation: move logic into deterministic TS CLIs; background-safe, no prompts.
  - Risk: Template placeholders leak â†’ Mitigation: CI guard added; manual sweeps until TS tooling lands.

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Created recovery journal 2025-08-13-1102 with BranchStatusAgent-format branch overview.
  - Logged prior PDCA cycles; fixed leftover placeholders; added CI check for template vars.
- Commands run (examples):

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - PDCA file created at: scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1203.md
  - Journal exists with expected sections and counts: scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> continue with manual PDCA logs. give feedback about the trouble with th shell not resonding and explain how the TSRanger and GiScrumProject tool will help and how web4x scenarios will solve it.

## Act
- Changed artifacts (GitHub first, then relative):
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1203.md): [scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1203.md](scrum.pmo/roles/ReleaseIntegrationAgent/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-1203.md)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md): [scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md](../../../project.journal/2025-08-13-1102/branch-overview.md)
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Implement Sprint 11 TS tools:
    - PR Reporter (release/dev), Journal Generator, Branch Overview Renderer (no shell), Protected-Path Scanner
  - Extend BranchStatusAgent tools with non-interactive mode and stable JSON outputs
- Automation to add:
  - TSRanger scenarios: encode recovery + journal generation as non-interactive sequences (deterministic IO), e.g., 
  - GitScrumProject flows: standardize template repo scaffolding and CI wiring for journal/PDCA automations
  - Web4x scenarios: repository-of-repos governance to run cross-repo status and journaling with the same TS tools
- Follow-ups:
  - Fix  to interpolate variables and return created path; add retries; integrate into CI.
