# PDCA — ReleaseIntegrationAgent — 2025-08-13 10:12 UTC

## Plan
- Objective: Provide reliable, auditable integration of `origin/feature/ontology-agent` role/process into `release/dev`, while hardening reporting and recovery journaling.
- Scope: Roles under `scrum.pmo/roles/**`, project journal `branch-overview.md` generation, CI guardrails for roles PRs.
- Targets (metrics):
  - Auto-PR created for any branch changing `scrum.pmo/roles/**`
  - Journal `branch-overview.md` contains real data (no placeholders)
  - Import outstanding OntologyAgent PDCA cycles
- Inputs (files/dirs):
  - `.github/workflows/{feature-to-dev.yml,roles-auto-pr.yml,roles-pr-scan.yml,eod-merge.yml}`
  - `scrum.pmo/templates/{project.state.template.md,branch-overview.template.md}`
  - `scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/**`
  - `scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-0729/branch-overview.md`
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - CI opens PRs for roles changes; journal presents resolved sections; role PDCA files imported
- Assumptions: GitHub API accessible for PR scans; repository permissions for PR creation
- Constraints: Avoid destructive merges; preserve local changes; non-interactive automation only
- Options Considered:
  - Inline shell vs TypeScript tools: chose CI + minimal shell now; TS tools scheduled for Sprint 11
- Rationale: Reduce brittleness and make state observable; TS tools to replace shell in follow-up
- Risks & Mitigations:
  - Risk: Deleting canonical assets in feature branch → Protect paths and do add/modify-only imports
  - Risk: Placeholder leakage → Regenerate branch overview with concrete data and add CI support

## Do
- Actions executed:
  - Hardened feature→dev workflow to fail fast and auto-PR
  - Added roles change auto-PR and hourly scan workflows
  - Imported OntologyAgent `process.md`, `templates/*`, `PDCA/*` into `release/dev`
  - Extended branch overview template and EOD generator with release/dev merged list
  - Materialized `2025-08-13-0729/branch-overview.md` via analysis script
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
git checkout release/dev && git pull --ff-only origin release/dev
git checkout origin/feature/ontology-agent -- scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent
git add scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent && git commit -m "docs(roles): import OntologyAgent role"

# Populate journal branch overview (simplified)
curl -s -H 'User-Agent: w4a' \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/pulls?state=open&base=release/dev&per_page=100" \
  | jq -r 'if length>0 then .[] | "- [ ] [#\(.number) \(.title)](\(.html_url)) from `\(.head.ref)` by @\(.user.login)" else "- [x] No open PRs targeting release/dev" end' \
  > /tmp/prs_dev.md
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
  - `release/dev` contains OntologyAgent role and PDCA files
  - Journal `branch-overview.md` shows unmerged/merged/merged-into-dev and PRs
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> ok but there is still not a real state in scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-0729/branch-overview.md but only the template variables. do a branch analysis now and update the file
- Evidence:
```bash
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | grep '^scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent/' | wc -l
sed -n '1,120p' scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-08-13-0729/branch-overview.md
```

## Act
- Improvements for next cycle:
  - Implement Sprint 11 TS tools: PR reporter, journal generator, branch overview renderer
  - Add background agent link enrichment for `cursor/*` branches
  - Extend quality checks to fail on placeholder tokens in journal outputs
- Automation to add:
  - Job to regenerate `branch-overview.md` on-demand via a TS tool
- Follow-ups:
  - Curated PR from `feature/ontology-agent` excluding destructive deletes
