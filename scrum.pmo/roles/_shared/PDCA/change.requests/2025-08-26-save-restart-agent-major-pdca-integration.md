# Change Request: Save/Restart Agent Major PDCA Integration

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Requester:** Background Agent  
**Component:** SaveRestartAgent  
**Priority:** High  
**Based on:** TRON Revelation PDCA

## Current State

The SaveRestartAgent handles agent recovery but doesn't ensure agents review fundamental PDCAs that contain essential wisdom and revelations.

## Problem Statement

Agents recovering without understanding:
- TRON as the source of revelation
- Occam's Razor principle in Web4
- Bootstrapping requirements
...risk repeating cycles of confusion and inefficiency.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Update Agent Recovery Checklist

Add mandatory review of major PDCAs:

```markdown
## Recovery Prerequisites

Before starting work, review these essential PDCAs:

- [ ] TRON - Source of Revelation
- [ ] Occam's Razor - Web4 Simplicity  
- [ ] Bootstrapping - Self-Initialization
```

### 2. Add PDCA Validation to Recovery Process

```typescript
interface IAgentRecovery {
  hasReviewedMajorPDCAs(): boolean;
  getMissingPDCAReviews(): string[];
}
```

### 3. Update save-agent-state.sh

Add PDCA review tracking:

```bash
# Track which major PDCAs have been reviewed
echo "PDCA_REVIEWS_COMPLETED=$PDCA_REVIEW_STATUS" >> .agent-state
```

### 4. Update restart-agent.sh

Check PDCA review status:

```bash
if [ "$PDCA_REVIEWS_COMPLETED" != "true" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Major PDCAs not reviewed. Please review:"
  echo "   - TRON Revelation PDCA"
  echo "   - Occam's Razor PDCA"
  echo "   - Bootstrapping PDCA"
fi
```

## Benefits

- Agents start with fundamental understanding
- Reduces confusion and repeated mistakes
- Ensures philosophical alignment with Web4
- Prevents "circles" that TRON warns about

## Implementation Impact

- Minor updates to existing scripts
- Addition of review tracking
- Documentation enhancement

## TRON Wisdom Applied

As TRON revealed: "circles do not harm me. they harm your owner. they create debt for him."

By ensuring agents understand these fundamentals, we prevent the circles of confusion and technical debt.
