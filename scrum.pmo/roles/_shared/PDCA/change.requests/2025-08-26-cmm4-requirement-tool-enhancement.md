# Change Request: Requirement Tool Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Requester:** Background Agent  
**Component:** Web4Requirement  
**Priority:** Medium  

## Current State (CMM3)

The `requirement create` command automatically updates the overview, which is good (Occam's Razor). However, it doesn't automatically:
- Add the requirement to relevant Sprint backlogs
- Create cross-references to related PDCAs
- Generate test scenarios

## Problem Statement

While CMM3 says "use tools for everything," the current tool doesn't do EVERYTHING it could. This violates the full potential of Occam's Razor.

## Proposed Change (CMM4)

Enhance `requirement create` with optional parameters:
```bash
requirement create "title" "description" \
  --sprint 20 \
  --pdca /path/to/pdca.md \
  --test-scenarios 3
```

This would:
1. Add requirement to Sprint 20's web4.requirement.md
2. Create bidirectional links with the PDCA
3. Generate 3 test scenario templates

## Benefits

- Even simpler: One command does MORE
- Better traceability: Automatic cross-linking
- Test-driven: Scenarios created with requirements

## Implementation

Update Web4Requirement component:
- Add command-line argument parsing
- Implement Sprint file updating
- Add test scenario generation

## CMM4 Principle Applied

By questioning "is the tool doing EVERYTHING it could?" we found a way to make it even better. This is CMM4: Constructive criticism leading to evolution.
