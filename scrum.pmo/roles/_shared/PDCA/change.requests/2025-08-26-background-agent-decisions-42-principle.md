# Change Request: Decisions 42 Principle Integration

**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Submitted by:** Background Agent  
**Type:** Process Enhancement  
**Priority:** High  

## Summary

Add the "Decisions 42" principle to SaveRestartAgent's recovery and PDCA validation processes.

## Current State

SaveRestartAgent validates PDCA format but doesn't explicitly check for the binary decision pattern (Ask or All Clear).

## Proposed Change

### 1. Add to SaveRestartAgent Recovery Checklist

When reviewing PDCAs during recovery:
- Verify QA Decisions follow "Decisions 42" principle
- Either meaningful questions OR "All Clear" declaration
- No placeholder decisions

### 2. Add to PDCA Validation

```python
def validate_qa_decisions(pdca_content):
    """
    Validate QA Decisions section follows Decisions 42 principle
    """
    # Check for either:
    # 1. Real decisions with options (ASK pattern)
    # 2. "All Clear" declaration
    # 3. No placeholder decisions like "Should we continue? Yes/No"
```

### 3. Add to Agent Training

Include in recovery documentation:
- **Decisions 42 = Binary Choice**
- **ASK**: Present real architectural/implementation decisions
- **ALL CLEAR**: Confirm no decisions needed
- **Reference**: [Decisions 42 PDCA](../../project.journal/2025-08-25-0947-external-references-learnings/pdca/role/background-agent/2025-08-26-UTC-2053-decisions-42-ask-or-all-clear.md)

## Benefits

1. **Clear Communication**: Binary signal improves efficiency
2. **No Waste**: Eliminates meaningless placeholder decisions
3. **Trust Building**: Agents know when to ask vs proceed
4. **Quality Improvement**: Better PDCA decision sections

## Implementation Notes

- Already added to `howto.PDCA.md` as mandatory principle
- Aligns with existing "no placeholder decisions" guidance
- Builds on "42 = FOR TWO" collaboration philosophy
