# PDCA Template (Background Agents)

Note: Name files `YYYY-MM-DD-UTC-HHMM.md` in each role's `PDCA/` directory.

**CRITICAL User Requirement**: After creating any PDCA, you MUST immediately provide a direct GitHub link in the chat:
```markdown
**PDCA Entry**: [2025-08-13-UTC-2003.md](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/branch/scrum.pmo/roles/YourRole/PDCA/2025-08-13-UTC-2003.md)
```
This is "mindblowing good" for QA! üçæüòéü•∞

**Important**: All PDCA entries must include links to artifacts:
- In "Do" section: List all files changed with markdown links and descriptions
- In "Check" section: If analysis-only (no changes), list artifacts analyzed
- Use relative paths from the PDCA file location (e.g., `../../../sprints/...`)

## Plan

- **Options Considered (with pros/cons):**
  - 
- **Rationale for Selected Option:**
  - 
- **Risks and Mitigations:**
  - 

## Do
- Actions executed:
- Artifacts changed (with links and descriptions):
  - [Path/to/file.md](relative/path/to/file.md) - Brief description of changes
  - [Another/file.ts](relative/path/to/file.ts) - What was modified
- Commands run (examples):
```bash
# Show current role tree and PDCA directory
TREE_WIDTH=2 tree -a -I 'node_modules|.git' scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent | sed -n '1,40p'

# Grep for ontology files to update counts
rg -n "^\|-\s*(Nouns|Verbs|Ambiguities):" Documentation/Ontology.md/ontology.status.md || true

# Verify new files staged
git status --porcelain=v1
```

## Check
- Verifications performed:
- QA Feedback (quote literally):
> [paste the exact QA/user prompt here]
- Artifacts analyzed (if no changes made):
  - [Path/to/analyzed/file.md](relative/path) - What was examined
- GitHub Links (when applicable):
  - PR: [#XXX](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/pull/XXX)
  - Files: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/branch/path)
  - Commit: [hash](https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/commit/hash)
- Evidence (snippets/commands):
```bash
# Count table rows (excluding header/separators)
awk 'BEGIN{FS="|"} /^\|/{c++} END{print c-2}' Documentation/Ontology.md/nouns.index.md

# Validate links (basic)
rg -n "\]\(\./|\]\(\.\./" Documentation/Ontology.md | sed -n '1,40p'
```
