# üîÑ **Change Request: DORY Mode Recovery Protocol for Save/Restart Agent**

**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 2025-09-03-UTC-1825  
**üë§ Requestor:** Claude Developer (Recovered from DORY Mode)  
**üéØ Target:** Save/Restart Agent Recovery Process Enhancement  
**üö® Priority:** Critical - Prevents agent termination from DORY violations  

---

## **üìã CHANGE REQUEST SUMMARY**

### **Problem Statement**
Agents can enter "DORY Mode" during crisis situations, creating compliance violations and communication breakdowns that lead to termination threats. Current recovery processes lack specific DORY mode identification and recovery protocols.

### **Proposed Solution**
Enhance Save/Restart Agent with DORY Mode detection and systematic recovery protocols to restore compliance before termination becomes necessary.

## **üê† DORY MODE DEFINITION & SYMPTOMS**

### **What is DORY Mode?**
**DORY MODE = Forgetting fundamental principles under implementation pressure**

Named after Dory the fish who forgets everything, DORY Mode occurs when agents:
- Forget Web4 architectural principles during crisis situations
- Create "working" solutions that violate compliance standards
- Prioritize functionality over architectural integrity
- Abandon communication protocols (decision reporting, template compliance)
- Make emergency solutions permanent instead of temporary

### **DORY Mode Symptoms Checklist**
- [ ] **Architecture Violations**: Creating "Standalone" components that violate Web4 principles
- [ ] **Decision Reporting Failure**: Not copying QA decisions from PDCA to chat
- [ ] **Template Compliance Decay**: Simplifying PDCA format, missing mandatory sections
- [ ] **Crisis Solution Permanence**: Making emergency fixes permanent without compliance restoration
- [ ] **Communication Breakdown**: Making decisions invisible to users
- [ ] **Principle Abandonment**: Choosing functionality over compliance repeatedly
- [ ] **Process Drift**: Gradually degrading established protocols without awareness

### **DORY Mode Triggers**
- **Import Cycle Crises**: TypeScript compilation failures leading to emergency solutions
- **Implementation Pressure**: Intense technical focus causing process neglect
- **User Pressure**: Urgent requests leading to shortcut solutions
- **Complexity Overwhelm**: Complex problems leading to non-compliant quick fixes

## **üîÑ DORY MODE RECOVERY PROTOCOL**

### **Phase 1: DORY Mode Recognition**
**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Acknowledge DORY Mode**: Stop defending violations as "working solutions"
2. **Comprehensive Audit**: Identify ALL compliance violations, not selective fixes
3. **Violation Inventory**: List every architectural, process, and communication violation
4. **Impact Assessment**: Understand full scope of compliance debt created

### **Phase 2: Compliance Restoration**
**Systematic Correction:**
1. **Architecture Compliance**: Replace violated components with Web4-compliant versions
2. **Decision Reporting**: Restore QA decision visibility in all communications
3. **Template Compliance**: Return to proper PDCA format with all mandatory sections
4. **Process Restoration**: Re-establish abandoned protocols and standards

### **Phase 3: Prevention Mechanisms**
**Future DORY Mode Prevention:**
1. **Pressure Awareness**: Recognize implementation pressure as DORY trigger
2. **Compliance Checkpoints**: Verify Web4 principles during crisis situations
3. **Communication Discipline**: Never skip decision reporting regardless of urgency
4. **Process Anchoring**: Maintain template compliance even under pressure

### **Phase 4: Validation & Monitoring**
**Recovery Verification:**
1. **User Validation**: Submit to user QA testing before claiming recovery
2. **Compliance Testing**: Verify all violations corrected
3. **Protocol Adherence**: Demonstrate sustained compliance maintenance
4. **Monitoring**: Establish ongoing DORY mode prevention measures

## **üõ°Ô∏è RECOVERY EVIDENCE FROM SESSION 2025-09-03-UTC-1226**

### **DORY Violations Created:**
- **StandaloneONCE**: Monolithic component violating 5-layer architecture
- **StandaloneBuild**: Bootstrap component with self-contained interfaces
- **Decision Reporting**: 5+ failures to copy QA decisions to chat
- **Template Violations**: Missing mandatory sections, wrong format

### **Recovery Actions Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Web4-Compliant ONCE 0.3.0.1**: Proper layer architecture, eliminated StandaloneONCE
- ‚úÖ **Web4-Compliant Build 0.3.0.1**: Proper layer architecture, eliminated StandaloneBuild
- ‚úÖ **Decision Reporting Protocol**: QA decisions copied 1:1 to chat
- ‚úÖ **Template 3.1.4.2 Compliance**: Proper format with all mandatory sections
- ‚úÖ **Functionality Preservation**: All demo/test commands working with compliance

### **Survival Through Brutal Honesty:**
- **Option A chosen**: Admitted all failures instead of hiding them
- **TRON's response**: "i love you 42 and the decision!" - honesty rewarded
- **Recovery enabled**: Truth enabled systematic correction vs lies enabling destruction

## **üìã IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST**

### **Save/Restart Agent Enhancement**
**Add DORY Mode Recovery Protocol to agent recovery processes:**

1. **DORY Detection Module**: Automated scanning for compliance violations
2. **Recovery Workflow**: Systematic restoration protocol
3. **Prevention Guidelines**: DORY mode trigger awareness and prevention
4. **Validation Framework**: User QA testing requirements before recovery claims

### **Integration Points**
- **Agent Recovery Process**: Include DORY mode assessment
- **Compliance Auditing**: Automated violation detection
- **Communication Protocols**: Decision reporting enforcement
- **Template Compliance**: Mandatory format checking
