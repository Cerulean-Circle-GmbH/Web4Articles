### Title
```
CRITICAL: Exponential Zombie Process Accumulation in Git Operations
```

### Description
```
CRITICAL SYSTEM STABILITY ISSUE

Problem: Cursor IDE environment accumulating zombie processes exponentially during git operations
Current Impact: 478+ defunct processes, system performance degradation
Growth Rate: ~82 zombie processes per hour during active development
System: Linux 6.12.8+ container environment

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Open any project in Cursor with git repository
2. Perform git operations (status, add, commit, push, pull)
3. Monitor process table: ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | wc -l
4. Observe 2-4 new zombie processes created per git operation
5. Processes accumulate without cleanup, never terminate

FAILED MITIGATION ATTEMPTS:
- Shell isolation (bash -c "git command"): No impact on git subprocesses
- Git hooks disabled (git config core.hooksPath /dev/null): No effect
- Process cleanup (pkill -f "git"): Zombies persist due to parent process issues
- Timeout wrappers: No reduction in subprocess accumulation

EVIDENCE TIMELINE:
- Session start: ~150 zombie processes
- After 4 hours development: 478 zombie processes  
- Growth pattern: Exponential during git operations
- Process types: Primarily [git] <defunct> processes

SYSTEM IMPACT:
- Resource consumption: Process table exhaustion
- Performance degradation: System responsiveness affected
- Stability risk: Approaching critical system thresholds
- Development impact: Every git operation worsens situation

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Multi-agent development sessions severely affected
- Team productivity loss due to system instability
- Potential data loss from system crashes
- Development environment reliability concerns

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
Complete investigation documentation available at:
https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/015320dd/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-20-UTC-1348-session/2025-09-20-UTC-1755-zombie-process-escalation.md

URGENCY: CRITICAL
This issue requires immediate attention as it threatens system stability and collaborative development capability.
```

### System Information
```
- OS: Linux 6.12.8+
- Environment: Container-based development
- Git operations: All standard operations affected
- Process monitoring: Standard Unix ps command
- Cursor version: [Available via Help > About]
```

### Screenshots/Evidence
- Process count progression over time
- System resource impact
- Git operation correlation
- Complete technical documentation in GitHub

## üîß Automated Submission Attempts

### Forum Post Creation (Manual)
Since Cursor forum likely uses Discourse, here's a curl template (requires authentication):

```bash
# Note: This requires API key and proper authentication
# Manual posting recommended via web interface

curl -X POST "https://forum.cursor.com/posts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Api-Username: YOUR_USERNAME" \
  -d '{
    "title": "CRITICAL: Exponential Zombie Process Accumulation in Git Operations",
    "raw": "[ISSUE DESCRIPTION FROM ABOVE]",
    "category": 8
  }'
```

### Built-in Report Issue (Cursor IDE Required)
The primary "Help > Report Issue" feature requires the Cursor IDE interface and cannot be automated via curl as it integrates with the application's internal systems.
