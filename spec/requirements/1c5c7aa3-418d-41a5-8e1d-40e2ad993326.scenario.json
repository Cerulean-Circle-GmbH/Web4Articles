    "description": "When implementing features or making changes, ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions. This reduces wrong implementations and fixing cycles. Apply Occam's Razor: the simplest approach is often asking for clarification rather than building based on assumptions. This is especially critical at CMM4 level where precision matters.",
