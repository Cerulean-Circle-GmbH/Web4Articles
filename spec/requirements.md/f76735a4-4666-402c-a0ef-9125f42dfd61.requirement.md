# Refactor RequirementOverviewGenerator to Layer5 MDView

## Task Status
- [ ] **Refactor RequirementOverviewGenerator to Layer5 MDView** [requirement:uuid:f76735a4-4666-402c-a0ef-9125f42dfd61]

## Requirement Details

- **UUID:** `f76735a4-4666-402c-a0ef-9125f42dfd61`
- **Name:** Refactor RequirementOverviewGenerator to Layer5 MDView
- **Status:** created
- **Implementation:** pending

## Description

The class RequirementOverviewGenerator is actually a view class that should implement MDView or extend from DefaultMDView. It should be named RequirementOverview and be moved to layer5. This aligns with the Web4 architectural principle that view components belong in layer5 (UX/UI, workflows, user actions, agent actions, views) not layer2 (implementations).
