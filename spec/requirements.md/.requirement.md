## Description

Scenarios are themselves Units that can be executed. Nested scenarios within a model should be stored as IOR references, not embedded scenario objects. The scenario has an attribute 'ior' (lowercase) of type 'IOR' (uppercase interface). This enables proper separation of concerns and prevents deep nesting of serialized data.
