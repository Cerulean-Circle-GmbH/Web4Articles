# Unit Component

**üéØ Purpose:** Web4 specification and management component for Units - the atomic executable elements within Web4 components

**üì¶ Version:** latestt  
**üèóÔ∏è Architecture:** Web4 Component (5-layer architecture)  
**üîó Dependencies:** Web4 Core, IOR System, Scenario Management  

## Overview

The Unit component defines and manages the fundamental concept of "Unit" in Web4 architecture. A Unit represents the smallest executable element within a Web4 component - the atomic building blocks that perform specific business logic operations.

## Component Purpose

### Core Responsibilities
- **Unit Specification**: Define what constitutes a Unit in Web4 architecture
- **Unit Discovery**: Identify and catalog units within components
- **Unit Coordination**: Enable unit-to-unit communication and collaboration
- **Unit Lifecycle**: Manage unit instantiation, execution, and hibernation
- **Unit Metadata**: Track unit capabilities, dependencies, and relationships

### Web4 Compliance
- **Empty Constructor Pattern**: All Unit objects use `constructor() {}` with scenario initialization
- **Scenario-Based State**: Complete unit state managed via scenario hibernation/restoration  
- **IOR References**: Unit-to-unit communication via Internet Object References
- **Network Distribution**: Units discoverable and executable across Web4 network

## Architecture

### Layer Structure
- **Layer 1 (Infrastructure)**: Unit registry, discovery protocols, network communication
- **Layer 2 (Implementation)**: Unit execution engine, scenario management, coordination logic
- **Layer 3 (Interface)**: Unit interface contracts, capability definitions, service contracts
- **Layer 4 (Orchestration)**: Unit workflow coordination, business process integration
- **Layer 5 (User Experience)**: Unit inspection tools, coordination interfaces, developer experience

## Usage Context

Units serve as the foundational building blocks for:
- **Component Architecture**: Components contain multiple coordinated units
- **Business Logic**: Units execute specific business operations and transformations
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Units compose into larger business processes
- **Testing**: Units provide testable atomic elements for component validation
- **Distribution**: Units can be discovered and executed across Web4 network boundaries

## Implementation Notes

This component will collect comprehensive information about Web4 units and serve as the authoritative specification for unit architecture, behavior, and coordination patterns throughout the Web4 ecosystem.
