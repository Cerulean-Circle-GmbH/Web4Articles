# Unit Component Specification

**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Comprehensive specification structure for Unit component requirements, scenarios, and architecture documentation

## Structure

### `/requirements/`
**Purpose:** Prose requirements converted to Web4 scenario format using Web4Requirement component

**Process:**
1. **Prose Input**: Requirements written in natural language prose format
2. **Scenario Conversion**: Web4Requirement component converts prose to structured scenarios
3. **Scenario Storage**: Requirements stored as `.scenario.json` files with UUIDs
4. **Traceability**: Each requirement scenario linked to implementation and tests

**Web4 Pattern:**
- Each requirement is a Web4 object instance with scenario hibernation
- Requirements tracked through complete lifecycle (pending â†’ in-progress â†’ completed)
- Bidirectional traceability to implementation units and test cases
- Evidence-based requirement validation and completion tracking

### Future Specification Areas

#### `/architecture/`
- Component architecture specifications
- Layer interaction definitions
- Interface contracts and service agreements

#### `/protocols/`
- Unit coordination protocols
- Communication patterns and message formats
- Evidence collection and audit trail specifications

#### `/integration/`
- Component integration specifications
- Dependency management and version compatibility
- Cross-component coordination patterns

## Web4 Requirement Integration

The specification uses the Web4Requirement component created in Sprint 21 for:
- **Requirement Object Management**: Each requirement as hibernatable Web4 object
- **Status Tracking**: Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed â†’ Cancelled lifecycle
- **MDView Generation**: Requirements overview files generated from object networks
- **Traceability Networks**: IOR-based links to implementation units and test cases

## Usage Pattern

1. **Prose Requirements**: Write requirements in natural language
2. **Scenario Conversion**: Convert to structured scenarios via Web4Requirement
3. **Scenario Storage**: Store as `.scenario.json` with UUID identification
4. **Implementation Linking**: Connect scenarios to implementation units
5. **Validation**: Evidence-based requirement completion tracking
