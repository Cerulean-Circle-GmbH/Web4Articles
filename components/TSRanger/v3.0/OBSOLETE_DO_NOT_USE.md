# ⚠️ WARNING: v3.0 IS OBSOLETE ⚠️

## DO NOT USE THIS FOLDER!

This v3.0 folder is **OBSOLETE** and exists only for historical reasons.

### The Real v3 Versions Are:
- **v3.n14.4/** - For Node 14.4 specific builds
- **v3.njs14/** - For Node.js 14 general builds

### Why This Exists:
1. Originally started as generic "v3.0"
2. Realized different Node versions needed different implementations
3. Created specific version folders (v3.n14.4, v3.njs14)
4. Never cleaned up this generic v3.0 folder
5. Now it's a confusing artifact

### What You Should Do:
- **NEVER** put new code in this v3.0 folder
- **ALWAYS** use the specific version folders
- **IGNORE** this folder completely
- **EDUCATE** other developers about this

### For Future Cleanup:
This folder should eventually be removed, but is kept for now to:
- Preserve git history
- Avoid breaking any legacy references
- Serve as a warning to others
