# ONCE Demo Status Report - All Clean ✅

## Process Status Check

### Manual `ps -edalf` Results
```bash
ps -edalf | grep -E "(server\.mjs|launch-demo|once-demo|node.*server)" | grep -v grep | grep -v cursor
```

**Results:**
- ❌ 20 zombie processes found (all defunct)
- ✅ NO active server.mjs processes
- ✅ NO running demo processes

### Zombie Processes
All found processes are in zombie state (Z flag, <defunct>):
- `[launch-demo.sh] <defunct>` - Original demo launcher
- Multiple `[launch-demo-v2.] <defunct>` - From testing sessions

**Note:** Zombie processes don't consume resources except a PID slot. They're waiting for parent (init) to reap them.

## Network Status Check

### Port 8080 Status
```bash
# Connection test
curl -v http://172.30.0.2:8080/health
Result: Connection refused

# Port check
lsof -i :8080
Result: Port 8080 is free
```

**Network Status:**
- ✅ Port 8080 is NOT in use
- ✅ No server listening
- ✅ Connection properly refused

## Summary

✅ **All ONCE demo processes have been stopped**
- No active server processes
- No WebSocket connections
- Port 8080 is completely free
- Only harmless zombie processes remain

## Clean State Verified

The system is in a clean state for starting new demos:
1. No conflicting processes
2. Network port available
3. Resources freed

### Next Demo Start
You can safely start a new demo:
```bash
cd /workspace/components/ONCE/0.1.0.0/examples/multi-env-demo
./launch-demo-v2.sh
```

### Zombie Cleanup (Optional)
Zombies will be cleaned on system reboot or by init process. They're harmless but if you want to force cleanup:
```bash
# This requires system-level access
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```
