# 🎮 ONCE Interactive Demo - Ready!

## ✨ What's New

### Interactive Keyboard Controls
- **Real-time control** of demo components
- **No more zombie processes** - everything cleaned up gracefully
- **Visual feedback** for all actions
- **Help menu** always available

### Keyboard Shortcuts
```
📋 Keyboard Controls:
─────────────────────
  [h] Show help menu
  [s] Start/Stop ONCE server
  [b] Launch Browser Client simulation
  [c] Launch Node.js Client
  [w] Launch Web Worker simulation
  [d] Discover peers (from all clients)
  [e] Exchange scenarios between clients
  [m] Show metrics and status
  [backspace] Clear screen
  [k] Kill all demo processes gracefully
  [q] Quit demo (with cleanup)
```

## 🚀 How to Start

### Option 1: Full Interactive Demo
```bash
cd /workspace/components/ONCE/0.1.0.0/examples/multi-env-demo
./launch-interactive.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Interactive Mode
```bash
cd /workspace/components/ONCE/0.1.0.0/examples
node multi-env-demo/interactive-demo.js
```

## 🛡️ Lifecycle Management Features

### Graceful Shutdown
- **SIGTERM first** - gives processes time to clean up
- **SIGKILL fallback** - ensures nothing is left running
- **PID tracking** - knows exactly what's running
- **Trap handlers** - catches all exit scenarios

### Process Management
```javascript
// Every process is tracked
state.processes.set(id, {
    name: 'Process Name',
    process: childProcess,
    pid: process.pid,
    type: 'server' | 'client',
    startTime: new Date()
});

// Graceful shutdown sequence
1. Send SIGTERM
2. Wait up to 5 seconds
3. Send SIGKILL if needed
4. Clean up tracking
```

### No More Zombies!
- Processes stay attached (`detached: false`)
- Exit handlers clean up children
- Emergency cleanup on unexpected exit
- System-wide process scan on shutdown

## 📊 Real IP Usage

The demo automatically detects and uses your real IP address:
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
# Example: 172.30.0.2
```

All components use this IP instead of localhost.

## 🎯 Demo Workflow

1. **Start the interactive demo**
   - Automatic dependency check
   - Clear visual interface
   - Help shown on startup

2. **Press 's' to start server**
   - Real IP detection
   - Health endpoint ready
   - WebSocket server active

3. **Launch clients with 1, 2, 3**
   - Each client gets unique ID
   - Automatic server connection
   - Ready for P2P communication

4. **Press 'd' for peer discovery**
   - Shows all connected clients
   - Displays peer relationships

5. **Press 'e' for scenario exchange**
   - Demos object sharing
   - Shows broadcast capabilities

6. **Press 'q' to quit cleanly**
   - All processes terminated gracefully
   - No zombies left behind
   - Resources properly freed

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### KeyboardController Class
- Event-driven architecture
- Configurable key bindings
- Built-in help system
- Error handling

### Interactive Demo Features
- Real-time process monitoring
- Visual status updates
- Graceful error recovery
- Clean separation of concerns

### Lifecycle Guarantees
```bash
# On exit, these always run:
1. Stop keyboard input
2. Close all WebSocket connections
3. Terminate all child processes
4. Clean up system processes
5. Remove PID tracking files
```

## 🎉 Try It Now!

The interactive demo is amazing because:
- **No manual process management** - just press keys
- **Visual feedback** - see what's happening
- **Safe to interrupt** - Ctrl+C works perfectly
- **Educational** - learn ONCE by doing

Start the demo and experience the power of ONCE with proper lifecycle management!
