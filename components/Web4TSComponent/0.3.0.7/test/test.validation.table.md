## Version Comparison Analysis

**Test Behavior vs 0.3.0.6:**
- **🟩 IDENTICAL:** All 28 tests show identical behavior patterns
- **📊 Statistics:** Both versions: 24 failed, 4 passed (85.7% failure rate)
- **🔍 Root Cause:** Same path resolution mismatch in both versions
- **🎯 Fix Strategy:** Project root mocking solution applies to both versions identically

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Path Resolution Mismatch between component creation and component lookup

**Technical Details:**
- **Component Creation:** Uses test mode, creates in `test/data/TestComponent/0.1.0.0`
- **Component Lookup:** `on()` method expects `components/TestComponent/0.1.0.0` (project root structure)
- **Test Expectations:** Hardcoded to check `components/TestComponent/0.1.0.0` paths

**Impact:** 24/28 tests fail (85.7% failure rate) due to infrastructure mismatch, not component logic issues

**Solution:** Project root mocking to align component creation and lookup paths

## Fix Status

**❌ Not Started:**
- Project root mocking infrastructure needs implementation for 0.3.0.7
- Test mode support needs to be added to DefaultWeb4TSComponent.ts
- ProjectRootMocker utility needs to be created

**📋 Required:**
- Apply same fixes as implemented for 0.3.0.6
- Path alignment in test expectations
- Verification of 100% test pass rate
