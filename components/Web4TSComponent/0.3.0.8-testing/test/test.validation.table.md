## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Path Resolution Mismatch (IDENTICAL to 0.3.0.6 and 0.3.0.7)
- Components created in `test/data` directory (✅ correct)
- Component lookup (`on()` method) searches in project root `components/` (❌ incorrect)
- Tests expect components in project root `components/` (❌ incorrect)

**Secondary Issue:** New Tree Method Implementation Issues (UNIQUE to 0.3.0.8)
- Tree method missing @cliDefault annotation for depth parameter
- Tree method missing default parameter syntax (= '3')

**Status:** Project root mocking needed ✅, path alignment needed 📋, tree method fixes needed 📋
