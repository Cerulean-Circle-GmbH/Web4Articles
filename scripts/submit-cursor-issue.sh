TITLE: CRITICAL: Exponential Zombie Process Accumulation in Git Operations

DESCRIPTION:
CRITICAL SYSTEM STABILITY ISSUE - Cursor IDE environment accumulating zombie processes exponentially during git operations.

Current Impact: 478+ defunct processes, system performance degradation
Growth Rate: ~82 zombie processes per hour during active development
System: Linux 6.12.8+ container environment

REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Open any project in Cursor with git repository
2. Perform git operations (status, add, commit, push, pull)
3. Monitor: ps aux | grep -E "\[.*\] <defunct>" | wc -l
4. Observe 2-4 new zombie processes created per git operation
5. Processes accumulate without cleanup, never terminate

FAILED MITIGATION ATTEMPTS:
- Shell isolation: No impact on git subprocesses
- Git hooks disabled: No effect
- Process cleanup: Zombies persist due to parent process issues

EVIDENCE: https://github.com/Cerulean-Circle-GmbH/Web4Articles/blob/015320dd/scrum.pmo/project.journal/2025-09-20-UTC-1348-session/2025-09-20-UTC-1755-zombie-process-escalation.md

URGENCY: CRITICAL - System stability threat requiring immediate attention
