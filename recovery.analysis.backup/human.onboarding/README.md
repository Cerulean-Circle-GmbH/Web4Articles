# Human Onboarding Documentation

This folder contains recovery and onboarding documentation written for **human team members**, not agents.

## Contents

- **role-based-recovery.md** - Detailed recovery instructions by human role (PO, Developer, etc.)
- **detailed-instructions.md** - Step-by-step explanations with context

## For Agents

Agents should use `../agent.recovery.md` instead - it's concise and command-focused.

## For Humans

These documents explain:
- Why certain steps are needed
- What each role does
- When to use different tools
- How to troubleshoot issues

Perfect for onboarding new human team members who need to understand the project deeply.
