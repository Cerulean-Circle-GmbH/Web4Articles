# 📋 **PDCA Cycle: Role-Specific Recovery Analysis - 2025-08-18-UTC-0952**

**🗓️ Date:** 2025-08-18-UTC-0952  
**🎯 Objective:** Analyze recovery process for each of the 6 project roles  
**👤 Role:** Developer (Role Analysis)  
**🚨 Issues:** Different roles have vastly different recovery requirements

## **✅ Summary**

**📊 QA Decisions**
- [x] Analyzed all 6 roles separately
- [x] Identified tool requirements per role
- [x] Calculated recovery times by role
- [x] Found lightest (SM/PO) and heaviest (DevOps)

## **📋 Plan**

### **Analysis Strategy**
1. Follow same structure as original analysis
2. Analyze each role separately
3. Identify prerequisites per role
4. Calculate recovery times
5. Find optimization opportunities

---

## **🔨 Do**

### **Role Analysis Results**

#### Lightest Roles (2 min)
- **ScrumMaster**: No tools needed
- **PO**: No tools needed

#### Medium Roles (3-5 min minimal)
- **Architect**: PlantUML can defer
- **Developer**: Node.js can defer
- **Tester**: Node.js can defer

#### Heaviest Role (20 min)
- **DevOps**: Needs everything upfront

### **Key Finding**
Recovery time varies from 2-20 minutes depending on role!

## **🔍 Check**

### **QA Feedback**
> **User Input**: "ok super. now create /workspace/recovery.analysis/recovery-process-analysis-role.md the same way as /workspace/recovery.analysis/recovery-process-analysis.md"  
> **Timestamp**: 2025-08-18-UTC-0952

### **Analysis Quality**
- ✅ Same structure as original
- ✅ Role-specific insights
- ✅ Clear time differences
- ✅ Practical recommendations

---

## **⚡ Act**

### **Key Insights**
1. SM/PO can recover instantly
2. Technical roles can defer tools
3. DevOps carries full burden
4. Average: 7 minutes across roles

### **Recommendations**
- Create role templates
- Add quick starts per role
- Consider DevOps-lite option

---

## **🎯 PDCA Process Update**

**Key Learning**: Role significantly impacts recovery time and complexity.

**Process Enhancement**: Role-specific recovery paths can optimize time.

**Quality Impact**: 90% reduction for documentation roles vs DevOps.

---

## **📝 One-Line Summary**
Analyzed recovery for all 6 roles showing ScrumMaster/PO need 2 minutes with no tools, technical roles need 3-5 minutes with deferred tools, and DevOps needs 20 minutes with everything.
