# Component

## Overview
Component represents self-contained, black-box objects with interfaces in the Web4x system, following the UCP quality gates.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Self-contained, black-box object with interface**

**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### The 4 Quality Gates
What makes something a proper component:

1. **Self-contained**: Everything in one place
2. **Black-box**: You don't need to know what's inside
3. **Interface**: Clear contract for how to use it
4. **Self-description**: Tells the system what it can do

### Component Architecture
- **Object Building**: Components are built according to UCP standards
- **Organization**: Components are organized in the system
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the system
- **Self-description**: Components tell the system what they can do

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Component`
- Will have a Default[Component] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
