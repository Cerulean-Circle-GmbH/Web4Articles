# UCP

## Overview
UCP (Component Architecture) defines how objects are built and organized in the Web4x system, ensuring objects are reusable and self-describing.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Component architecture defining object building and organization**

**Source**: [README.md](../../md-wiki/README.md#2-ucp---the-component-architecture)  
**Line**: 35  
**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### The 4 Quality Gates
What makes something a proper component:

1. **Self-contained**: Everything in one place
2. **Black-box**: You don't need to know what's inside
3. **Interface**: Clear contract for how to use it
4. **Self-description**: Tells the system what it can do

### Component Architecture
- **Object Building**: Defines how objects are constructed
- **Organization**: Defines how objects are structured
- **Reusability**: Ensures objects can be reused
- **Self-description**: Objects tell the system what they can do

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Class](#class)**: Object-oriented programming construct
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface UCP`
- Will have a Default[UCP] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
