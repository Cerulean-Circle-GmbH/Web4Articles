## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Integration`
- Will have a Default[Integration] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
