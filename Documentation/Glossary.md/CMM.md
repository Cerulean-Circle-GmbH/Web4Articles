# CMM

## Overview
CMM (Capability Maturity Model) represents a fundamental framework that defines 5 maturity levels for any capability, determining how efficiently and predictably work can be performed. Web4x specifically targets **CMM Level 4 (Managed)** to achieve sustainable resilient change through automated feedback loops.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Capability Maturity Model**: A framework measuring the maturity of any capability (WHAT) based on how it's executed (HOW), with 5 distinct levels from chaotic to optimized.

**Source**: [Why-4.0.md](../../md-wiki/web4x/codingWeb4.wiki/Why-4.0.md)  
**Lines**: 26-67  
**Enhanced from**: [ontology.agent.md](../../Ontology.md/ontology.agent.md)

### Core Principle
**"Any Capability (WHAT) can be done in multiple different ways (HOW) but therefore results in very different characteristics that form a level of maturity."**

## Key Characteristics

### CMM Levels (Detailed)

#### **Level 1: Chaotic**
- **Characteristics**: Try and error, unexpected results, confusion, misunderstandings, maximally expensive
- **Context**: First time doing something
- **Performance**: Unpredictable outcomes, high cost

#### **Level 2: Repeatable** 
- **Characteristics**: Templates created but incomplete, differ from others' approaches
- **Context**: 10th or 100th time doing something
- **Performance**: Outperforms Level 1 but still inconsistent results regarding time, resources, and quality
- **Measurement**: Results have noise level, not fully predictable

#### **Level 3: Defined**
- **Characteristics**: Everything defined and automated (e.g., software process), guarantees constant measurement points
- **Context**: Complete definitions covering all cases, automated processes
- **Performance**: Consistent time, resources, and quality measurements
- **Achievement**: Major effort to reach but outperforms all Level 2 operations

#### **Level 4: Managed** ⭐ **Web4x Target**
- **Characteristics**: **Automated feedback loop** between measured output and changed inputs for better future output
- **Context**: Capability to change the Level 3 process reliably (e.g., 10% faster, 30% cost savings)
- **Performance**: **Resilient adoption to change** through predictable process improvements
- **Achievement**: **Web4x specifically targets this level** for sustainable resilient change

#### **Level 5: Optimized**
- **Characteristics**: Absolute best performance, typically forced by external authority (FDA, FAA)
- **Context**: Life-critical systems, exorbitant failure costs (e.g., space missions)
- **Performance**: **Pareto-inefficient** - 80% additional effort for only 20% improvement
- **Decision**: Not voluntarily chosen due to cost-benefit ratio

### Web4x CMM Implementation

#### **CMM Level 4 Application**
**"Web 4.0 is the consequent application of CMM 4 methods to achieve a CMM 4 world wide web that enables sustainable resilient change to save the existence of humanity from their potential to extinct themselves."**

#### **Key CMM Insights for Web4x**
1. **Paradigm Shifts**: Each CMM level increase requires changing the paradigm (HOW) while keeping the capability (WHAT) the same
2. **Composed Capability**: When combining capabilities of different maturity levels, the lowest maturity determines overall maturity
3. **Industrial Evolution**: Software + Robotics enables industry to achieve CMM 3 and 4 for the first time
4. **Software Development Maturity**: Current software development is still more "manufacturing art" than "industrial process"

#### **Why Never CMM 5.0**
- **Level 4 is Sustainable**: Once managed level is achieved, focus shifts to maintaining and improving existing system
- **No Fundamental Shifts**: Incremental improvements rather than developing entirely new systems
- **Web4x Sufficiency**: Level 4 provides the automated feedback loops needed for resilient change

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface CMM`
- Will have a Default[CMM] implementation class  
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping
- **CMM Level 4 Target**: Web4x implements automated feedback loops for sustainable resilient change

### CMM Compliance in Web4x Ontology
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project (all terms clearly defined)
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring (ontology agent updates)
- **Automated Feedback**: Ontology system provides feedback loop for terminology consistency
- **Resilient Change**: System adapts to new terms while maintaining definitional integrity

### Key Implementation Insights
1. **Paradigm Focus**: CMM advancement requires changing HOW (implementation) not WHAT (capability)
2. **Lowest Common Denominator**: Combined system maturity limited by least mature component
3. **Software Development Challenge**: Current industry operates at manufacturing art level, not industrial process level
4. **Economic Principle**: Level 5 optimization is Pareto-inefficient unless forced by regulation

### Historical Context
- **Lost Knowledge**: Humanity repeatedly loses mature software development practices (PL1 mainframes → COBOL → Java JEE → current fragmentation)
- **The Last Architecture**: Represents retained "big picture" knowledge being implemented through Web4x
- **Educational Gap**: CMM principles largely absent from current curricula despite economic importance
