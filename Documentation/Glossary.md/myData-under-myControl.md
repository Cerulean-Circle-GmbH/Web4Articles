## Key Characteristics

### User Sovereignty
- **Complete Control**: Users have full control over their data
- **Personal Data**: All personal information under user control
- **Digital Assets**: User-owned digital assets and resources
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protection

### Web4x Integration
- **Object-Oriented Data**: Personal data as objects in Web4x
- **Digital Twin Data**: Data can be represented as digital twins
- **Cross-Platform Control**: Control data across different platforms
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Integrated with identity management

### Security Features
- **Private Security**: Fundamental security concept
- **Data Ownership**: Users own their data completely
- **Consent Management**: Users control data sharing
- **Privacy Protection**: Built-in privacy safeguards

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system
- **[ONCE](#once)**: Interoperating system enabling object communication

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface MyDataUnderMyControl`
- Will have a Default[MyDataUnderMyControl] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
