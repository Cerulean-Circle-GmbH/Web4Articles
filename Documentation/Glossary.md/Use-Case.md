# Use Case

## Overview
Use Case represents a description of a functional requirement in terms of activities and objects, providing a meaningful result to an actor in the Web4x system.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**A description of a functional requirement in terms of activities and objects. A use case provides a meaningful result to an actor.**

## Key Characteristics

### Use Case Structure
- **Functional Requirement**: Specific functionality to be implemented
- **Activities**: Actions performed within the use case
- **Objects**: Entities involved in the use case
- **Meaningful Result**: Clear outcome for the actor

### Abbreviation
**UC** - Use Case

### Web4x Integration
- **Object-Oriented Use Cases**: Use cases as objects in Web4x
- **Component-Based**: Use cases built from UCP components
- **Digital Twin Representation**: Use cases can be represented as digital twins
- **Actor Interaction**: Clear interaction patterns with actors

## Related Concepts

### Direct Dependencies
- **[Actor](#actor)**: The one who interacts with a system
- **[Business Process](#business-process)**: A bunch of resources doing useful steps

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system
- **[ONCE](#once)**: Interoperating system enabling object communication

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface UseCase`
- Will have a Default[UseCase] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
