## Overview
Business Process represents a structured sequence of activities where resources perform useful steps in order to achieve a goal in the Web4x system.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**A bunch of resources are doing useful steps in order to achieve a goal**

**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### Process Structure
- **Resources**: Multiple resources working together
- **Useful Steps**: Meaningful activities that contribute to the goal
- **Goal-Oriented**: Clear objective to be achieved
- **Sequential**: Steps performed in order

### Abbreviation
**BP** - Business Process

### Web4x Integration
- **Object-Oriented Processes**: Business processes as objects in Web4x
- **Digital Twin Integration**: Processes can be represented as digital twins
- **Component-Based**: Processes built from UCP components
- **Automated Feedback**: CMM Level 4 process management

## Related Concepts

### Direct Dependencies
- **[Use Case](#use-case)**: Functional requirements in terms of activities and objects
- **[Actor](#actor)**: The one who interacts with a system

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system
- **[ONCE](#once)**: Interoperating system enabling object communication

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface BusinessProcess`
- Will have a Default[BusinessProcess] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
