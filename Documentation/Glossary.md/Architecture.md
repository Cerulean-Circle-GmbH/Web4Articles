# Architecture

## Overview
Architecture represents the structural design of the Web4x system, defining how components are organized and interact with each other.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition

## Key Characteristics

### Web4x Architecture
Web4x represents the next generation of web architecture, positioning itself as "the Internet of Services as a basis for the Internet of Things" derived from TLA (The Last Architecture).

### Core Architectural Components
- **[ONCE](#once)**: The communication engine enabling object interoperability
- **[UCP](#ucp)**: Component architecture defining object building and organization
- **[EAMD.ucp](#eamd-ucp)**: Foundation repository for enterprise architecture management
- **[WODA](#woda)**: Development environment for building Web4x objects

### Architectural Principles
- **Object-Centric**: Everything is an object in the architecture
- **Interoperable**: Components can communicate across the web
- **Self-Describing**: Components tell the system what they can do
- **Reusable**: Components can be reused across the system

## Related Concepts

### Direct Dependencies
- **[ONCE](#once)**: "First interoperating system" enabling object communication
- **[UCP](#ucp)**: Component architecture defining object building and organization

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Methodology](#methodology)**: Structured approach to research and development
- **[Paradigm](#paradigm)**: Fundamental approach to web development

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Architecture`
- Will have a Default[Architecture] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
