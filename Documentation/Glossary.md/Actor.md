# Actor

## Overview
Actor represents the entity who interacts with a system in the Web4x environment, playing a crucial role in use cases and business processes.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**An Actor is the one who interacts with a system**

## Key Characteristics

### Actor Types
- **Human Actors**: People who interact with the system
- **System Actors**: Other systems that interact with the system
- **External Actors**: Entities outside the system boundary
- **Internal Actors**: Entities within the system boundary

### Web4x Context
- **Object-Oriented Actors**: Actors as objects in Web4x
- **Digital Twin Actors**: Actors can have digital twin representations
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Actors control their own identity
- **Cross-Platform Interaction**: Actors can interact across different platforms

### Interaction Patterns
- **Use Case Participation**: Actors participate in use cases
- **Business Process Involvement**: Actors involved in business processes
- **System Communication**: Actors communicate with system components
- **Identity Management**: Actors manage their own identity

## Related Concepts

### Direct Dependencies
- **[Use Case](#use-case)**: A description of a functional requirement in terms of activities and objects
- **[Business Process](#business-process)**: A bunch of resources doing useful steps

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Interface](#interface)**: Clear contract defining how objects communicate

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system
- **[ONCE](#once)**: Interoperating system enabling object communication

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Actor`
- Will have a Default[Actor] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
