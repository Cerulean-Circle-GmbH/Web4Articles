# Agent

## Overview
Agent represents autonomous entities performing various tasks in the Web4x ecosystem, including research, ontology management, and cross-referencing.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Autonomous entity performing tasks (research, ontology, cross-referencing)**

**Source**: [research.agent.md](../../md-wiki/AI.Agent.setup/research.agent.md#research-agent-definition)  
**Line**: 1  
**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### Agent Types
Multiple agent types have been identified without clear classification:

1. **Research Agent**: Specialized in WODA methodology (What, Overview, Details, Actions)
2. **Ontology Agent**: Creates and maintains noun and verb indexes
3. **Cross-referencing Agent**: Interlinks crossreferences and backlinks automatically

### Agent Capabilities
- **Autonomous Operation**: Work independently in remote environments
- **Auto-Execution**: Run terminal commands and tests automatically
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status with intervention capabilities
- **Seamless Handoff**: Easy transition between agent and human work

### Direct Dependencies
- **[WODA methodology](#woda)**: What, Overview, Details, Actions methodology

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Methodology](#methodology)**: Structured approach to research and development
- **[Structure](#structure)**: Organized framework for research and documentation
- **[Lifecycle](#lifecycle)**: Complete process from creation to maintenance

### System Components
- **[Configuration](#configuration)**: Setup and customization of agent behavior
- **[Integration](#integration)**: Connection between different systems and components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components

## Ambiguities Identified

### Multiple Types Ambiguity
**Issue**: Research agent, ontology agent, cross-referencing agent - unclear if same concept

**Sources**:
- [research.agent.md](../../md-wiki/AI.Agent.setup/research.agent.md#research-agent-definition):1 (Research agent)
- [ontology.agent.md](../../Ontology.md/ontology.agent.md):1 (Ontology agent)

**Resolution Needed**: Establish agent taxonomy and relationships between different agent types

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Agent`
- Will have a Default[Agent] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
