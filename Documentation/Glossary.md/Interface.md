# Interface

## Overview
Interface represents clear contracts defining how objects communicate in the Web4x system, with multiple meanings depending on context.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Clear contract defining how objects communicate**

**Source**: [README.md](../../md-wiki/README.md#2-ucp---the-component-architecture)  
**Line**: 35  
**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### Multiple Meanings
Interface can refer to different concepts:

1. **Programming Interface**: Clear contract for how to use objects
2. **UI Interface**: User interface components and interactions

### UCP Quality Gate
Interface is one of the 4 Quality Gates for proper components:
- **Self-contained**: Everything in one place
- **Black-box**: You don't need to know what's inside
- **Interface**: Clear contract for how to use it
- **Self-description**: Tells the system what it can do

## Related Concepts

### Direct Dependencies
- **[UCP](#ucp)**: Component architecture defining object building and organization
- **[ONCE](#once)**: "First interoperating system" enabling object communication

### Implementation Concepts
- **[Object](#object)**: Fundamental unit in Web4x - everything is an object
- **[Component](#component)**: Self-contained, black-box object with interface
- **[Class](#class)**: Object-oriented programming construct

### System Components
- **[Repository](#repository)**: Storage system for objects and components
- **[Architecture](#architecture)**: Structural design of Web4x system
- **[Methodology](#methodology)**: Structured approach to research and development

## Ambiguities Identified

### Multiple Meanings Ambiguity
**Issue**: Can refer to UI interface or programming interface

**Sources**:
- [README.md](../../md-wiki/README.md#2-ucp---the-component-architecture):35 (Programming interface)
- [ai.web4x.first.principles.md](../../md-wiki/ai.web4x.first.principles.md#1-radical-object-oriented-programming-radical-oop):35 (Programming interface)

**Resolution Needed**: Distinguish between interface types (UI vs Programming)

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Interface`
- Will have a Default[Interface] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
