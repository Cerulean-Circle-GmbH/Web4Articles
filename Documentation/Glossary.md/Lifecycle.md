# Lifecycle

## Overview
Lifecycle represents the complete process from creation to maintenance in the Web4x system, particularly for agent and component management.

## Definitions

### Primary Definition
**Complete process from creation to maintenance**

**Line**: 50  
**Character**: 1

## Key Characteristics

### Project Structure Integration
Lifecycle is part of the project structure that includes:
- **Agent Management**: Complete lifecycle management for agents
- **Component Lifecycle**: From creation to maintenance of components
- **System Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance and updates
- **Process Management**: Manage complete processes

### Lifecycle Phases
- **Creation**: Initial creation of components and agents
- **Development**: Development and testing phase
- **Deployment**: Deployment and activation
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance and updates
- **Retirement**: End-of-life and retirement

### Management Capabilities
- **Process Tracking**: Track processes through their lifecycle
- **Status Monitoring**: Monitor status at each lifecycle phase
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure quality throughout lifecycle
- **Continuous Improvement**: Improve processes over time

## Implementation Notes

### Web4 Future
- Will become a TypeScript interface: `interface Lifecycle`
- Will have a Default[Lifecycle] implementation class
- Cross-references will be maintained for relationship mapping

### CMM Compliance
- **Level 3**: Unambiguous definitions maintained across project
- **Level 4**: Agile improvement of indexes through continuous monitoring
