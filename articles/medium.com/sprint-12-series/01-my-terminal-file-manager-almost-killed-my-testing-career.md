# My Terminal File Manager Almost Killed My Testing Career

*A TypeScript developer's descent into test hell (and the tiny change that saved everything)*

---

## The Dream That Every Developer Has

You know that feeling. You've just built something coolâ€”in my case, a terminal-based file manager called TSRanger. It works! You can navigate directories, select files, even preview content. The dopamine hits hard.

```bash
$ node --loader ts-node/esm src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts
```

Beautiful. Interactive. Responsive. Time to write some tests and ship it.

## When Good Code Goes Bad

Here's where every developer's story diverges from the dream:

```typescript
describe('TSRanger', () => {
  it('should select files when pressing space', () => {
    const result = spawnSync('node', [
      '--loader', 'ts-node/esm',
      'src/ts/layer4/TSRanger.ts'
    ]);
    // This test never completes...
  });
});
```

The test hung. Forever. My beautiful interactive program was waiting for keystrokes that would never come.

No problem, I thought. I'll just send it some input:

```typescript
const result = spawnSync('node', [...], {
  input: ' \n'  // Space to select, enter to confirm
});
```

Still hanging. 

## The Descent Into Madness

What followed was every developer's nightmare multiplication table:

**Hour 1-2**: "I'll just mock the input stream"  
**Hour 3-4**: "Maybe I need a different spawn method"  
**Hour 5-6**: "What if I use a pseudo-terminal?"  
**Hour 7-8**: "Maybe I should rewrite the whole input system"  

Each "solution" created two new problems. My test file grew from 50 lines to 500. My confidence shrank proportionally.

## The Wall Every Developer Hits

Then came the moment that almost made me quit:

```
$ ls -la src/
total 72K
drwxr-xr-x  ts/
drwxr-xr-x  test/
-rw-r--r--  package.json
```

One source directory. One test directory. Everything mixed together. And now my boss wants "TSRanger v2 with new features."

Where do I put v2? Do I:
- Copy everything to `src-v2/`? (ðŸ¤®)
- Use git branches forever? (ðŸ˜±)
- Start a new repo? (ðŸ’€)
- Just... give up? (ðŸ˜¢)

## The Tiny Change That Changed Everything

Ready for the anticlimactic solution that saved weeks of pain?

```bash
export TSRANGER_TEST_MODE=1
```

That's it. One environment variable. In my code:

```typescript
const isTestMode = process.env.TSRANGER_TEST_MODE === '1';
if (isTestMode) {
  // Read input from TSRANGER_TEST_INPUT instead of keyboard
  const input = process.env.TSRANGER_TEST_INPUT || '';
  // Process and exit instead of waiting
}
```

Tests suddenly worked:

```typescript
it('selects files with space', () => {
  const env = {
    TSRANGER_TEST_MODE: '1',
    TSRANGER_TEST_INPUT: ' \n'
  };
  const result = spawnSync('node', [...], { env });
  expect(result.stdout).toContain('[*]'); // Selected!
});
```

## But What About That Version Problem?

Ah yes, the "one src directory" wall. That's a story for another article. But here's a hint: the solution was hiding in plain sight, in a pattern from 1968 that I'd never heard of.

## Your Test Hell Might Be Different

Maybe you're not building a terminal UI. Maybe your tests fail because:
- They're flaky due to timing issues
- They require complex database states
- They depend on external services
- They're just... too hard to write

Here's what I learned: **When testing is painful, it's not your fault. It's feedback.**

Your architecture is trying to tell you something. In my case, it was saying "interactive programs need a non-interactive mode."

## The Questions That Could Save You Weeks

Next time you're in test hell, ask:

1. What is my code waiting for that tests can't provide?
2. What would a "test mode" look like for my application?
3. What's the smallest change that could make this testable?

Don't rewrite everything. Don't mock the universe. Sometimes all you need is one environment variable and a different way of thinking.

## What's Next?

In the next article, I'll share how that "one src directory" problem led to discovering an architecture pattern that changed how I think about code organization forever. Spoiler: the solution was older than the internet itself.

But for now, if you're stuck in test hell, remember: you're not alone, you're not stupid, and the solution might be simpler than you think.

*P.S. - Yes, my tests still aren't perfect. Yes, I still sometimes write tests after the code. Yes, I'm human. That's the point.*
