let me show you.

i renamed it as a link to 'requirement' to easier type the command manually.
but the setup is broken. ivestigate an fix it for this usage usecase.

### **My Answer**
Investigated the broken requirement CLI setup and discovered multiple issues: symlink pointing to v1.0 instead of latest, missing TypeScript compilation, import extension conflicts, and Node.js experimental TypeScript interference. Fixed all issues systematically with direct ts-node execution approach for reliable TypeScript development workflow.

**Learning Applied:** Symlink resolution requires careful path handling, and TypeScript CLI tools need proper ts-node configuration to avoid Node.js experimental feature conflicts while maintaining development flexibility.

---

## **📋 PLAN**

**Investigation and Fix Strategy:**
1. Analyze current requirement command failure and symlink configuration
2. Identify root cause: symlink pointing to v1.0 with missing compiled JS files
3. Create new requirement.sh in latest version with ts-node direct execution
4. Fix TypeScript import extensions for ts-node compatibility
5. Resolve Node.js experimental TypeScript conflicts with proper loader configuration
6. Update symlink to point to latest version
7. Validate source.env environment check function
8. Test complete CLI functionality end-to-end

**Technical Requirements:**
- Direct TypeScript execution using ts-node with --loader flag
- Proper symlink resolution from scripts/requirement to latest version
- TypeScript import extensions (.ts) for development mode
- Context detection for component-aware operations
- Environment validation integration

---

## **🔧 DO**

**Implementation Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ **Issue Investigation:** Identified symlink pointing to `components/Web4Requirement/v1.0/requirement.sh`
   - Error: Looking for compiled JS at `scripts/dist/ts/layer5/RequirementCLI.js`
   - Root cause: v1.0 script expects compiled output, but no build process exists
2. ✅ **Latest Version Analysis:** Located target TypeScript source at `components/Web4Requirement/latest/src/ts/layer5/RequirementCLI.ts`
3. ✅ **New Requirement Script Creation:** Built comprehensive 78-line script with:
   - Proper symlink resolution using `readlink -f`
   - PROJECT_ROOT detection and context awareness
   - ts-node availability checking with project-local and global fallback
   - TypeScript configuration validation
4. ✅ **TypeScript Import Fix:** Updated all .js extensions to .ts in 5 files:
   - RequirementCLI.ts: DefaultRequirement import
   - DefaultRequirement.ts: Requirement, UnitIndexStorage, RequirementOverview imports
   - DefaultMDView.ts: View, DefaultTemplateProcessor imports  
   - DefaultTemplateProcessor.ts: View import
   - MDOverview.ts: View, DefaultMDView imports
   - RequirementOverview.ts: DefaultMDView, View, Requirement imports
5. ✅ **Node.js Conflict Resolution:** Configured proper ts-node loader:
   ```bash
   NODE_OPTIONS="--loader=ts-node/esm --no-experimental-strip-types"
   ```
6. ✅ **Symlink Update:** `rm scripts/requirement && ln -s ../components/Web4Requirement/latest/requirement.sh scripts/requirement`
7. ✅ **Environment Validation Fix:** Updated source.env to check for `requirement` command instead of `requirement.sh`
8. ✅ **End-to-End Testing:** Successfully created test requirement with UUID 7bc34094-7160-4a8f-a99e-03a38323bc97

**CLI Functionality Verified:**
```bash
Web4Requirement CLI Tool

Commands:
  create     Create a new requirement with title and description
  md         Load requirement from scenario and generate MD view
  set        Set attribute value for existing requirement
  update     Update and regenerate components (overview)
  mv         Move requirement files to another component
```
