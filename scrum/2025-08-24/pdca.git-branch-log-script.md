# PDCA: Git Branch Log Script Creation

**üìÖ Date:** 2025-08-24  
**üéØ Objective:** Create a script that generates pretty printed git log with branch lines and saves to timestamped file  
**üë§ Role:** Developer  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues:** None  
**üìé Previous Commit:** c61fdf9 - Added My Answer section: Enhanced PDCA format with immediate response integration after TRON feedback  
**üîó Previous PDCA:** N/A - Initial script creation request  

## Summary

**Artifact Links:**
- [GitHub Scripts](https://github.com/mcdonges/Web4Articles/blob/release/dev/scripts/git-branch-log.sh) | [../scripts/git-branch-log.sh](../scripts/git-branch-log.sh)

**QA Decisions:**
- [x] Create script with UTC timestamp naming pattern
- [x] Include git log with colors and branch lines
- [x] Save to temp directory with specified format
- [ ] User confirmation of script functionality and naming pattern

---

## Plan

Create a bash script that:
1. Generates UTC timestamp in format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
2. Uses git log with --graph for branch lines
3. Applies color formatting for readability
4. Saves output to temp/git.[timestamp].branch.log.ansi.txt
5. Shows confirmation message with file details

**Technical Specifications:**
- Format: `git.[UTC timestamp].branch.log.ansi.txt`
- Location: temp/ directory
- Colors: Red hash, yellow decorations, white subject, green date, blue author
- Options: --graph --all --decorate --color=always

---

## Do

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Created `/scripts/git-branch-log.sh` with proper UTC timestamp generation
2. ‚úÖ Added git log command with comprehensive formatting options
3. ‚úÖ Included temp directory creation and file output
4. ‚úÖ Made script executable with `chmod +x`
5. ‚úÖ Tested script successfully - generated 1519 lines in `git.20250824-101821.branch.log.ansi.txt`

**Script Features:**
- UTC timestamp generation using `date -u +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"`
- Pretty format with colors for hash, decorations, subject, date, and author
- Branch graph visualization with `--graph` option
- All branches included with `--all` flag
- ANSI color codes preserved in output file

---

## Check

**QA Feedback:** [Pending user validation]

**Verification Results:**
‚úÖ Script created successfully at `/scripts/git-branch-log.sh`  
‚úÖ Script is executable (`chmod +x` applied)  
‚úÖ Test run generated file with correct naming pattern: `git.20250824-101821.branch.log.ansi.txt`  
‚úÖ Output contains 1519 lines of git history  
‚úÖ File saved to temp/ directory as specified  
‚úÖ UTC timestamp format matches requirement  

**File Content Validation:**
- Script includes comprehensive git log formatting
- Colors preserved with `--color=always` flag
- Branch visualization enabled with `--graph`
- All commits included with `--all` flag
- Proper error handling with temp directory creation

---

## Act

**PDCA Process Update:**
Script successfully created and tested. Ready for user validation and potential refinements.

**Next Actions:**
1. Await user confirmation of script functionality
2. Consider additional formatting options if requested
3. Document script usage in project documentation if approved

üìù **One-line Summary:** Successfully created git branch log script with UTC timestamped output and colorized branch visualization in temp directory
